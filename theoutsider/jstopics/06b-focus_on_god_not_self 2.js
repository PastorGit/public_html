However, most of do not realize that the most exclusionary sin of all was that we were born Gentiles.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">It\'s funny some of us are quite proud of our lineage. Some of haves studied our family tree and are fascinated and buoyed by the grit and determination of our ancestors. What is shocking is that despite the wonderful luminaries in our family, in the eyes of God they were nothing and nobodies who had no hope and had utterly no standing before him. By rights, God could have and should have passed over our entire family line from top to bottom and ignored each of our tribes totally. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">That\'s not even mentioning the pathetic good deeds we have claimed to have done in God\'s name. Many Christian\'s are very proud of their spiritual lineage and accomplishments. It is inescaple really. At times it is appropriate, even important, to understand a person\'s background. But most of the time it\'s puffery and showing off. What we don\'t realize that it can become a real obstacle in praying the prayer of faith and receiving from God. Let\'s all ask ourselves this question, when was the last time I prayed to God for a specific request and I received exactly what I asked for? <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If God hasn\'t been answering our prayers lately, maybe, just maybe, it\'s because we have been trusting in our good works and not in finished work of Christ.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
