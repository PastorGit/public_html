hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Syro-Phoenician woman comes to Jesus in the home he was staying in. I want to paint a proper picture. The entire region was under Roman control, but the Romans are allowing these different nations to live according to their borders and in relative peace as long as they pay taxes. Jesus is now in a different nation, even though it was still under the control of Rome. There are Jews living in Tyre and Sidon, like there were Jews living in other areas of the Roman empire. So Jesus is probably staying in a Jewish home. I am going to speculate that he might even be staying in a Jewish home in a Jewish neighborhood. My point is, Jesus is not holding a crusade or anything like that. It\'s almost like he is lying low. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">This is not a stretch. The Pharisees and Jewish rulers were committed to killing Jesus. Jesus often met this threat by withdrawing and hiding. This seems strange to our ears, but Jesus always knew the perfect thing to do at the perfect time. Sometimes it is better to flee a situation than to stay in a situation.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Therefore, it is reasonable speculation to surmise that Jesus left the borders of Israel to lie low with a friend in another part of the Roman empire until things settled down a bit. In the meantime, this Syro-Phoenician hears about Jesus being in a Jewish neighborhood and goes to find him. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<h2 style=\"margin: 1.1875rem 0 1.1875rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.64rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-weight: bold;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\n\r"
