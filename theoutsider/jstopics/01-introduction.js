And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden. 25 But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet. 26 Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. 27 And he said to her, “Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children\'s bread and throw it to the dogs.” 28 But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children\'s crumbs.” 29 And he said to her, “For this statement you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.” 30 And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In this sermon we will continue to explore the words of Jesus. We come to an interesting passage where a Syrophoenician woman implores Jesus to exorcise a demon out of her daughter. This is a short passage, but it has a lot of meaning for our lives.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">First, list give some context to the passage. Jesus had been in the nation of Israel ministering and had encounered opposition from the Pharisees which we have been talking about. After putting the Pharisees in their place, Jesus does something interesting. He leaves Israel and enters a different region, Tyre and Sidon, which is non-Jewish territory, or rather outside of Israel\'s borders.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Tyre and Sidon were two major cities of Phoenicia which was a huge shipping and commerce center. This region and its people are mentioned often in the Bible, usually notoriously. The Phoenicians trace their ancestry back to the Canaanites, a people group who inhabitated the Promised Land, and who were staunch haters of God. Indeed, the Canaan, the father of the Canaanites, was cursed by Noah. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">You might recall that when Israel was preparing to invade the Promised Land, that is the land of Canaan, God instructed Joshua to kill everyone...men, women and children, and often even to destroy the livestock. The Canaanites had for centuries embraced religions that glorified human sacrifice, violence, idolatry, demon worship and every form of sexual perversion. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Some Canaanites mixed with a race of giants. While Bible scholars do not agree on the origins of the giants in the Promised Land, many ancient Jews believed these giants were the demonic offspring of fallen angels and humans. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Further, while the kings of Tyre and Sidon had some positive relations with the kings of Israel, the most notorious Queen in Israel\'s history, Queen Jezebeel, was a descendant of a Sidonian king (1 Kings 16:31–32). Therefore, any descendant of Canaan would not be viewed positively by an Israelite.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Both Mark and Matthew record this incident in their Gospel accounts, and both accent the woman\'s ancestry and neither gives the woman\'s name. The woman\'s Gentile ancestry is important to undestanding Jesus\'s interaction with this person. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The other aspect of the context I want to zero on is that Jesus is intentionally in this region. It is true he intended to be hidden, but we know from the Gospel accounts that Jesus could rarely stay hidden. We also know that where ever Jesus went, something wonderful would happen. He would ended preaching, teaching, healing the sick, casting out demons, raising the dead and performing miracles. There is no reason to believe that this visit to Tyre and Sidon is going to yield different results. However, for a moment, it seems like it is going to be different.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
