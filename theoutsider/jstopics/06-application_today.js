Not every prayer is answered right away, and sometimes things seem to get worse before they get better. This could be God testing us to see what we really believe. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">John 12:20<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">21 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">20 Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. 21 So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">These Greeks wanted to see Jesus. But it went no further. They didn’t press in. Sometimes people are just curiosity seekers. They want to try this “faith stuff” out. But that’s not how faith works. You have to be in all the way.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">A Single Desire<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">This is a simple concept, but great faith is focused on receiving a single thing. The Syro-Phoenician woman knew what she wanted. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Sometimes in our prayer meetings, people will say,<\/span><span class=\"f_quote\"> “Pray for my neighbor, he or she is sick.”<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> However, many times these requests come across as top of the head. You have to realize there is a difference between prayer and faith. We can pray in unbelief. Our goal is to pray in faith. To pray in faith we have to be specific. And to be specific we have to provide details and understand what is going enough so that you can properly discern what the need is.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I\'ll use myself as an example because I don\'t want you to think I\'m picking on you. If a friend or loved one is sick, usually I have to talk to that person and find out what is going, try to locate spiritually so that I can pray effectively. Often I pray for Christians differently than non-Christians. I pray for people I know well that are struggling with specific sins that have contributed to their sicknesses differently than someone who is going through an attack from the enemy. This includes myself. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Here\'s the point, if you want God to answer your prayer, you have to believe that in your heart that is he going to do what you ask. The issue isn\'t whether God can or if God is willing, as much as whether we are being specific in our praying. &nbsp;I can say, <\/span><span class=\"f_quote\">&quot;Let\'s pray for all the hungry people in the world&quot;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">, but that is a toothless prayer because it is so vague and general. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I can start praying for the food pantries near where I live. I can start visiting them and talking to the volunteers that work there and find out what they need and start praying for the volunteers by need and pray for their specific needs. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Focus on God Not Self<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We all have committed sin. We all have done shameful deeds. However, most of do not realize that the most exclusionary sin of all was that we were born Gentiles.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">It\'s funny some of us are quite proud of our lineage. Some of haves studied our family tree and are fascinated and buoyed by the grit and determination of our ancestors. What is shocking is that despite the wonderful luminaries in our family, in the eyes of God they were nothing and nobodies who had no hope and had utterly no standing before him. By rights, God could have and should have passed over our entire family line from top to bottom and ignored each of our tribes totally. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">That\'s not even mentioning the pathetic good deeds we have claimed to have done in God\'s name. Many Christian\'s are very proud of their spiritual lineage and accomplishments. It is inescaple really. At times it is appropriate, even important, to understand a person\'s background. But most of the time it\'s puffery and showing off. What we don\'t realize that it can become a real obstacle in praying the prayer of faith and receiving from God. Let\'s all ask ourselves this question, when was the last time I prayed to God for a specific request and I received exactly what I asked for? <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If God hasn\'t been answering our prayers lately, maybe, just maybe, it\'s because we have been trusting in our good works and not in finished work of Christ.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
