hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Who are the children in the passage? The children is a reference to God’s covenant people. Jesus is unmistakeably saying that he is sent to Israel, and his ministry of healing and deliverance is for the Jew first. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">The Dogs<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The dogs, or perhaps better understood, little dogs, refer to Gentiles. Now I want to steer the conversation away from dogs for a minute. Why? Because in the West we love dogs. Indeed, in America some love their dogs more than they love people. Therefore, for the purposes of this sermon, I need to stretch the illustration somewhat. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_emphasis\" style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 8.1250rem 1.0000rem 5.7500rem;\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Illustration: Squirrels, Chipmunks and Rabbits<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_emphasis\" style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 8.1250rem 1.0000rem 5.7500rem;\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\">Where I live there are a lots of little mammals like squirrels, chipmunks and rabbits. They are a nuisance especially because they get in the garbage and they eat my flowers. But baby mammals are cute, and I don\'t blame them for being hungry.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_emphasis\" style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 8.1250rem 1.0000rem 5.7500rem;\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\">Sometimes I’ll leave old vegetables or fruit for the chipmunks and rabbits. Since, I like to see the baby squirrels play tag, sometimes I\'ll throw out bread or rice for them. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_emphasis\" style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 8.1250rem 1.0000rem 5.7500rem;\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\">These bunny rabbits are God\'s creation, so I\'m not going to take a BB gun and shoot them. But I\'m not letting them into my house, and I\'m not trying to tame them. I don\'t feed them special food like I feed my dog.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 8.1250rem 0 5.7500rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">When my dog sees me he comes to me. When chipmunks see me they run as if their lives depended on it, even though, I mean them no harm.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_emphasis\" style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 8.1250rem 1.0000rem 5.7500rem;\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\">At this point in God\'s timeline, Gentiles are like the baby mammals in my yard. They enjoy common grace, but they are wild and outside of the house. They are not under God\'s protection. They are not family. They don\'t get special benefits. And for the most part, because of sin, they are running from God. The metaphor is flawed but you get the point. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">As a Gentile, the woman was in the words of Paul, an outsider:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Ephesians 2:11<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">13 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">11 Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called “the uncircumcision” by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands— 12 remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Jesus\'s Comment<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Don\'t let me primitive illustration obscure the reality that Jesus, in speaking to the woman in this way, he is testing the woman’s faith. The only way she was going to receive deliverance for her daughter if is she could get her eyes off herself and her lineage and get them completely on God. So Jesus raised the question about her ancestry.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Again, the fact that both Gospel accounts emphasize her ancestry and don\'t tell us her name is significant. The fact that this Gentile woman worships God is significant as well. We have a Gentile woman who loves God. But her respect for God and the Jewish Bible does not overrule her Gentile past. Imagine a scale. One on side of the scale is the woman\'s love for God, knowledge of the Bible, love for her daughter, her faith. On the other side of the scale is her Gentile past. Based on what Jesus just said, her past is heavier than her all the things she has going in her favor. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">No here is the thing, and I speculating here but I going to explain why my speculation seems right to me. I believe that the woman has this scale in her mind. In other words, she is self-conscious about her Gentile past. She is trying to overcome it, but she can\'t. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">By raising the issue of her past, Jesus is making her confront it and showing her how to overcome it. She overcomes it by embracing accepting who she is and accepting who God is.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Sin and Humility<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">28 But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children\'s crumbs.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In her reply, the woman first acknowledges that Jesus is God and worthy of glory and honor. She then agrees with God that she is indeed a Gentile dog. She is accepting her sinfulness. This is critical.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The foundation of having faith in God is understanding that we are sinners and have no standing in God apart from Christ. Millions of people throughout history, have tried to find God on their own terms. They have tried approach God without first acknowledging that they were sinners in need of cleansing and salvation. They do this because they believe there is a chance, however remote, that there some spark, some light, some residue, some act of goodness within them that will somehow appeal to a holy and just God and compel him provide aid, comfort and answers on the basis of that goodness. They are mistaken.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Jews in Jesus\'s day thought that they could win favor with God by keeping the laws of Moses. They hoped by observing all the commandments they could become righteous and therefore merit the favor of God that would manifest in the form of national deliverance from slavery from the Romans. They were mistaken.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Gentiles had no such hope. Unlike the Jews, they were categorically denied the smallest hope of pleasing God because their ancestry doomed them. Although, Gentiles converted to Judaism, the conversion was not transformative. They were still Gentiles by birth and therefore lesser than. Whatever opinions various rabbis might have had about the matters, Jesus was affirming that Gentiles were on the outside.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In accepting this reality for what it was and agreeing with it, the Syro-Phoenician woman overcame it. It was if a light bulb went off in her spirit. She shifted her petition to one that was not based on her and who she was, but on God and who he was. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Her reply, <\/span><span class=\"f_quote\">&quot;even the dogs under the table eat the children\'s crumbs<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">&quot; is a Scriptural reference to the fact that God always intended to bring Gentiles into his family and throughout history has always shown goodness to Gentiles. It is a reply filled with the humble acknowledgement that she was sinful and came from a sinful ancestry and had no rights and privileges before God. Yet is a reply filled with hope that despite her utter unworthiness that God would be good to her, because in fact that was his nature. As Paul writes in Ephesians describing God\'s work of bringing Gentiles to faith:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Ephesians 2:4<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">5 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">A Probable Theory<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I believe this reasoning to be sound for two reasons. First, Jesus went to a Gentile nation. If he was truly opposed to healing Gentiles, he wouldn\'t have gone there. Everywhere Jesus went, something good happen and it hard to believe that he would be amongst Gentiles and something good not happen--think of the Samartitan woman at the well.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Therefore, Jesus\'s interaction with the woman was for the outcome to be blessing and deliverance, not for the outcome to be for the woman and her daughter to stay oppressed and heartbroken.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Secondly, throughout his ministry, Jesus emphasized the critical role of faith in receiving God\'s blessings. When it came to healing and deliverance, Jesus was not a Calvinist. What people believed or didn\'t believe had a direct and immediate consequence on what they received from God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.8750rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
