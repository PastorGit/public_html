hmBody:"<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Mark 7:24<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">30 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">24 And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden. 25 But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet. 26 Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. 27 And he said to her, “Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children\'s bread and throw it to the dogs.” 28 But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children\'s crumbs.” 29 And he said to her, “For this statement you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.” 30 And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In this sermon we will continue to explore the words of Jesus. We come to an interesting passage where a Syrophoenician woman implores Jesus to exorcise a demon out of her daughter. This is a short passage, but it has a lot of meaning for our lives.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">First, list give some context to the passage. Jesus had been in the nation of Israel ministering and had encounered opposition from the Pharisees which we have been talking about. After putting the Pharisees in their place, Jesus does something interesting. He leaves Israel and enters a different region, Tyre and Sidon, which is non-Jewish territory, or rather outside of Israel\'s borders.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Tyre and Sidon were two major cities of Phoenicia which was a huge shipping and commerce center. This region and its people are mentioned often in the Bible, usually notoriously. The Phoenicians trace their ancestry back to the Canaanites, a people group who inhabitated the Promised Land, and who were staunch haters of God. Indeed, the Canaan, the father of the Canaanites, was cursed by Noah. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">You might recall that when Israel was preparing to invade the Promised Land, that is the land of Canaan, God instructed Joshua to kill everyone...men, women and children, and often even to destroy the livestock. The Canaanites had for centuries embraced religions that glorified human sacrifice, violence, idolatry, demon worship and every form of sexual perversion. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Some Canaanites mixed with a race of giants. While Bible scholars do not agree on the origins of the giants in the Promised Land, many ancient Jews believed these giants were the demonic offspring of fallen angels and humans. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Further, while the kings of Tyre and Sidon had some positive relations with the kings of Israel, the most notorious Queen in Israel\'s history, Queen Jezebeel, was a descendant of a Sidonian king (1 Kings 16:31–32). Therefore, any descendant of Canaan would not be viewed positively by an Israelite.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Both Mark and Matthew record this incident in their Gospel accounts, and both accent the woman\'s ancestry and neither gives the woman\'s name. The woman\'s Gentile ancestry is important to undestanding Jesus\'s interaction with this person. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The other aspect of the context I want to zero on is that Jesus is intentionally in this region. It is true he intended to be hidden, but we know from the Gospel accounts that Jesus could rarely stay hidden. We also know that where ever Jesus went, something wonderful would happen. He would ended preaching, teaching, healing the sick, casting out demons, raising the dead and performing miracles. There is no reason to believe that this visit to Tyre and Sidon is going to yield different results. However, for a moment, it seems like it is going to be different.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">The Canaanite Woman<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Syro-Phoenician woman comes to Jesus in the home he was staying in. I want to paint a proper picture. The entire region was under Roman control, but the Romans are allowing these different nations to live according to their borders and in relative peace as long as they pay taxes. Jesus is now in a different nation, even though it was still under the control of Rome. There are Jews living in Tyre and Sidon, like there were Jews living in other areas of the Roman empire. So Jesus is probably staying in a Jewish home. I am going to speculate that he might even be staying in a Jewish home in a Jewish neighborhood. My point is, Jesus is not holding a crusade or anything like that. It\'s almost like he is lying low. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">This is not a stretch. The Pharisees and Jewish rulers were committed to killing Jesus. Jesus often met this threat by withdrawing and hiding. This seems strange to our ears, but Jesus always knew the perfect thing to do at the perfect time. Sometimes it is better to flee a situation than to stay in a situation.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Therefore, it is reasonable speculation to surmise that Jesus left the borders of Israel to lie low with a friend in another part of the Roman empire until things settled down a bit. In the meantime, this Syro-Phoenician hears about Jesus being in a Jewish neighborhood and goes to find him. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">An Odd Woman with an Odd Problem<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_body\">Maybe Jesus was in a Jewish neighborhood, maybe he wasn\'t, but he was in a Jewish home. And it takes a certain kind of brazenness for a Gentile woman to enter the home of Jewish man. I mean this wasn\'t done. It violated cultural norms. First, Jews did not deal with Gentiles. Second, in those days, the man was the priest of his home. Third, the near-Eastern traditions of hospitality were sacred. Put all these factors together and it would have been extraordinarily unusual for a Jewish man to let a Canaanite woman into his house and let her touch Jesus in any way. My feeling is that she burst into the home and clutched Jesus\'s feet in desperation.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Syro-Phoenician woman was odd. She was a Gentile living in a world where non-Jewish religion was the norm, but she chose to worship the Israel\'s God. She evidently was connected to the Jewish community in some way, a people who would have despised her ancestry, and whom the people in culture probably didn\'t like or didn\'t trust. She also had a stubborn independence that was unusually manifest in for women who from childhood were taught to be submissive, quiet and obedient. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Now this woman has a problem. It\'s funny how odd people often how odd problems. Her daughter was demon possessed. Her daughter wasn’t merely sick; she had a demon. In BWCC we don’t get too many prayer requests like that: <\/span><span class=\"f_quote\">“pray for my son, he has a demon.”<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> But what is also interesting, that when odd people, have odd problems and they desperately need a problems, they don\'t mess around with protocol. This woman threw herself at the feet of Jesus and asks Jesus to cast the demon out of her daughter. Jesus’s reply is: <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">“Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children\'s bread and throw it to the dogs.” <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I’ve look this passage up in commentaries, and let me share something with about commentaries. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">A commentary is a scholarly text written by a scholar or team of scholars to explain the bible. They study the text in the original language, research what other scholars have written, consult archeological texts, and other historical works to try and piece together and accurate way to interpret the passage. Often commentaries can give useful facts that help us understand the passage better. For example, more than one commentary I consulted pointed out that the word for dog that Jesus used referred to pet dogs not the dogs that roamed the streets that Jews especially despised. Okay, so that’s pretty helpful. Jews despised dogs, and to call someone a “dog” was a tremendous insult, but Jesus was using a different word, that wasn’t flattering but it wasn’t the insult that it couldn’t been.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">On the other hand, commentaries can be confusing because commentaries often contradict each other. One commentary I read implied that Jesus and the woman were sharing an inside joke and that Jesus wasn’t really being serious. Another commentary explained that Jesus was addressing a political situation between Judea and Tyre, in that Tyre was depriving Judea of bread. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I’m sharing this because we can’t just run to commentaries all the time to understand the Bible. We have to think. We have to pray. We have to listen. We have to meditate on Scripture to do our best to come up with an explanation that resonates with us even though it will be limited and imperfect.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Either way you look at it, Jesus is not speaking to this woman in flattering terms. I struggled with this. Different commentaries interpreted Jesus’s words differently, so there isn’t a definitive interpretation hidden in the original language or in the culture.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
