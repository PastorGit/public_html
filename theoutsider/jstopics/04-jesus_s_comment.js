hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Don\'t let me primitive illustration obscure the reality that Jesus, in speaking to the woman in this way, he is testing the woman’s faith. The only way she was going to receive deliverance for her daughter if is she could get her eyes off herself and her lineage and get them completely on God. So Jesus raised the question about her ancestry.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Again, the fact that both Gospel accounts emphasize her ancestry and don\'t tell us her name is significant. The fact that this Gentile woman worships God is significant as well. We have a Gentile woman who loves God. But her respect for God and the Jewish Bible does not overrule her Gentile past. Imagine a scale. One on side of the scale is the woman\'s love for God, knowledge of the Bible, love for her daughter, her faith. On the other side of the scale is her Gentile past. Based on what Jesus just said, her past is heavier than her all the things she has going in her favor. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">No here is the thing, and I speculating here but I going to explain why my speculation seems right to me. I believe that the woman has this scale in her mind. In other words, she is self-conscious about her Gentile past. She is trying to overcome it, but she can\'t. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">By raising the issue of her past, Jesus is making her confront it and showing her how to overcome it. She overcomes it by embracing accepting who she is and accepting who God is.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.8750rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
