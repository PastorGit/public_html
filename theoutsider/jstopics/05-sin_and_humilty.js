hmBody:"<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">28 But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children\'s crumbs.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In her reply, the woman first acknowledges that Jesus is God and worthy of glory and honor. She then agrees with God that she is indeed a Gentile dog. She is accepting her sinfulness. This is critical.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The foundation of having faith in God is understanding that we are sinners and have no standing in God apart from Christ. Millions of people throughout history, have tried to find God on their own terms. They have tried approach God without first acknowledging that they were sinners in need of cleansing and salvation. They do this because they believe there is a chance, however remote, that there some spark, some light, some residue, some act of goodness within them that will somehow appeal to a holy and just God and compel him provide aid, comfort and answers on the basis of that goodness. They are mistaken.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Jews in Jesus\'s day thought that they could win favor with God by keeping the laws of Moses. They hoped by observing all the commandments they could become righteous and therefore merit the favor of God that would manifest in the form of national deliverance from slavery from the Romans. They were mistaken.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Gentiles had no such hope. Unlike the Jews, they were categorically denied the smallest hope of pleasing God because their ancestry doomed them. Although, Gentiles converted to Judaism, the conversion was not transformative. They were still Gentiles by birth and therefore lesser than. Whatever opinions various rabbis might have had about the matters, Jesus was affirming that Gentiles were on the outside.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In accepting this reality for what it was and agreeing with it, the Syro-Phoenician woman overcame it. It was if a light bulb went off in her spirit. She shifted her petition to one that was not based on her and who she was, but on God and who he was. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Her reply, <\/span><span class=\"f_quote\">&quot;even the dogs under the table eat the children\'s crumbs<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">&quot; is a Scriptural reference to the fact that God always intended to bring Gentiles into his family and throughout history has always shown goodness to Gentiles. It is a reply filled with the humble acknowledgement that she was sinful and came from a sinful ancestry and had no rights and privileges before God. Yet is a reply filled with hope that despite her utter unworthiness that God would be good to her, because in fact that was his nature. As Paul writes in Ephesians describing God\'s work of bringing Gentiles to faith:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Ephesians 2:4<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">5 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
