hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If you read the passages in their full context on your own time, you will see that the resurrection of Jesus has important faith implications for the believer. By God is validating the following:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">That the Bible is the Word of God and Truth<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">The Apostles emphasize that God raised Jesus &nbsp;to the Scriptures. By raising Jesus therefore, God is validating that the Scriptures are true. If the Old Testament books are riddled with human error, inconsistencies, pagan myths and fairy tales, they are not . The resurrection means that God the Father confirms the Bible as truth.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">The Jesus selected Apostles and entrusted them to proclaim and publish his message which they did in their letters. Specifically, the Apostle Paul’s ministry was validated by the other witnesses to Christ’s resurrection. So, the New Testament letters have the same weight and authority the Old Testament because in raising Jesus, God was validating the ministry that Jesus gave the Apostles.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">That Jesus is God<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 3.3125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">The phrase “Jesus is Lord” means that Jesus is God, and the truth of Jesus being God is validated by the resurrection. As Peter said, this Jesus whom you crucified God has made both Lord and Christ<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 3.3125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">There are different implications here, but the obvious one is the confirmation of one God in three . God raised Jesus from the dead bodily, e Spirit of the Son with the dead body that Mary’s womb produced. Jesus ascended bodily, which means the Godhead is now what it wasn’t beforeit &nbsp;consists of a man, Jesus of Nazareth who is inseparable from God the Son.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 3.3125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">God the Father exist in a human body, &nbsp;God the Son forever exists as God and full man. This is a great wonder, but it expresses God’s incomparable love and commitment to man!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">That Jesus is the Chosen One<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 3.3125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">The terms Messiah, Christ, and Chosen One are biblical titles for Jesus (the , Chosen One is found in Isaiah 42). Each title carries the meaning of Jesus being specially selected by God to accomplish a purpose. However,the words Messiah and Christ are so laden with religious that the immediate definition is lost on American ears. The &nbsp;“Chosen One” is less religious and perhaps better captures Jesus’s purpose. Because Jesus is the Chosen One, it is only through Jesus that man may be saved<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 3.3125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">God has settled the common argument that atheists often use to trouble Christians. Perhaps you have heard these arguments, such as: Who are you to say that Jesus is the only way to heaven?How can you know that other religions aren’t true? e know this because God raised Jesus from the dead. By doing so, God confirmed that Jesus was the Messiah, the Anointed One, the Chosen One, and there is no other name given under heaven by which men may be saved.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">That in Jesus Our Sins are Forgiven<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 3.3125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">Under the Law, God did not forgive some sins<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 3.3125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">However, the blood of Jesus is so powerful, and God’s mercy extended to us is so great that even unforgivable sins are forgiven in Christ. This truth is eternally validated in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">That Jesus is the Final Judge<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 3.3125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">God has appointed Jesus to be the final judge for everything and everyone. although our sins forgiven, we will account to Jesus for the life we have lived during this time on earth.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 3.3125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">The resurrection of Jesus assures us that all men will indeed be resurrected and judged.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 3.3125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">That means we should be eager to stop sinning and abusing God’s grace and get busy for Jesus! Remember: deliverance can take time. If we sincerely want to be free from sin but &nbsp;with lust, addictions, fear, etc. God will help us. Don’t discouraged; sometimes putting off the old man takes time. I am talking about those believers who sin and that God doesn’t care. They are deceived.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 3.3125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">Jesus being the judge means that we can be assured that Jesus will judge believers and non-believers alike fairly, justly and with compassion. Again, should not let unbelievers confuse us about what will happen to those who never heard about Jesus and such arguments. Jesus will judge justly.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_close\"><span class=\"f_close\">In the name of God, Amen<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
