They had overcome Ziklag and burned it with fire 2 and taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great. They killed no one, but carried them off and went their way. 3 And when David and his men came to the city, they found it burned with fire, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive. 4 Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until they had no more strength to weep. 5 David’s two wives also had been taken captive, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel. 6 And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in soul,[<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=1%20Samuel%2030:1-6&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-7985b\" class=\"weblink\">b<\/a><\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\">] each for his sons and daughters.
