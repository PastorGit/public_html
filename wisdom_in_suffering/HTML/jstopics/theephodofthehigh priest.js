Attached to the inside of this ephod was a cloth pouch with the Urim and Thummin. We do not know precisely what the Urim and Thummin were — they could have been smooth stones for example — but the high priest used whatever they were to discern the will of God. For example, in Ezra Jewish leaders wanted to use the Urim and Thummin to determine the ancestry of priests whose lineage was disputed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">Ezra<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">2:63<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">NET<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">The governor instructed them not to eat any of the sacred food until there was a priest who could consult the Urim and<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\">Thummin.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Many priests may have had an ephod, but only the high priest had an ephod with the Urim and Thummin.
