hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If God has used a human vessel to correct you, don’t focus on the ship; focus on what God is saying to you. In the kingdom of God, Jesus will restore every believer. Sometimes that correction will be private. Sometimes it will be semi-private. Sometimes it will be public. You don\'t understand the Lord well if you are resentful for being corrected. The important thing is to receive divine correction and make adjustment.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span class=\"f_close\">In the name of God, Amen<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
