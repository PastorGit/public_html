Instead of withering and dying, it has mutated into a more virulent and deadly strain. Almost with a mind of its own, it seems to rebuke humanity’s reckless and disobedient behavior. The papers are heartbreaking stories of people who, with their last breath, wished they had not been so foolish as to reject the COVID-19 vaccine. Sadly, they found that the COVID-19 virus extends no grace, no mercy and offers no do-overs. It does only what it knows to do, what all viruses do, and that is to survive at the expense of the host it occupies.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I’m reading a book about the last days of the Trump presidency, written by two respected journalists. Books about the inner workings of a presidential administration are exciting but can be political hit jobs by disgruntled former employees. Although it is tough to get the whole truth, I tend to favor journalists because it is their calling to be forensic and investigative. This book confirmed what I was reading in other sources all along, that the President and his administration downplayed the seriousness and lethality of COVID-19 and the necessity of wearing masks and social distancing and all of that for twisted political reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I am reading the book of Jeremiah at the same time, where the kings and nobles of Judah are downplaying the threat of Babylon for twisted reasons. God’s people have been led astray with harsh consequences in both cases.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I rarely talk about politics from the pulpit. I certainly don’t promote a partisan preference from the pulpit. I led our church in prayer for our president during President Trump\'s presidency. However, I think there is historic culpability regarding the pandemic that can be laid at President Trump’s feet. Much of the public doubt about science, vaccines, mask-wearing, social distancing, and heeding the advice of experts were directly correlated to the president\'s words, actions, tweets and attitude. His efforts led to unnecessary loss of life.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Importantly, because President Trump was especially adored by a large swath of Christians in America, it is fair to say that vaccine hesitancy, distrust of science, and refusal to wear masks. Therefore, it is also reasonable to conclude that preventable suffering due to COVID-19 has also hit Christians hard. I think the latter half of the story isn’t being told. I don’t believe the body of Christ is being honest about COVID–19-related deaths in their families and their churches. Indeed, we are now hearing reports about family members asking coroners to remove COVID-19 as the cause of death from death certificates.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">However, if the president had been humble enough to take the advice of his advisers, including his children, and just worn a mask in public, many pastors would have followed suit. Perhaps, many more Christians would have gotten in line, and more lives would have been spared.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Norman Vincent Peale, a champion of positive thinking, heavily influenced President Trump. Most journalistic profiles of President Trump I have read emphasized that Trump was maniacal about keeping everything positive. For example, I believe his ridiculous assertion that COVID-19 would disappear was rooted in a misguided application of positive thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Although this sermon will not be a dissection of positive thinking, suffice it to say that the basic concept of thinking positively is biblical. Of course, live every Biblical concept; it can be pushed to the extremes and be taken out of context. While one cannot make COVID-19 go away by thinking positively, finding an effective vaccine for COVID-19 in record time involves positive thinking.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The tension between these two kinds of optimism brings us to the text. When Satan asked Jesus to jump off a cliff, he tempted Jesus with Scripture.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">The Test<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When Satan tempted Jesus with Scripture, he said, “Look, if you throw yourself down, God won’t let any harm come to you.” We can’t appreciate the temptation until we contemplate Jesus’s response: “You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.” Satan was right in that the Scripture said God promised to his people. However, Satan took the biblical promise out of context. <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">Jesus understood that the point of God’s deliverance is not that we act recklessly to force God to deliver us.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> We don’t jump off a cliff to see if God will prevent us from being killed. Jesus’s answer to Satan teaches us that we must have more than a superficial understanding of the Word of God. We must understand the narrative and context of the Scripture to understand its meaning. <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">Otherwise, we can be tempted to be reckless in the name of faith and religion.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">How to Protect Ourselves<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In this age of COVID–19, we must first understand that it is not the role of anyone in a local church to give medical advice. Pastors, acting as pastors, are not called to provide medical advice, nor are elders or the laity. It is not our role to judge a person’s medical care. Amid a global pandemic, doctors are qualified to dispense medical advice to their patients. If you have a question about whether a vaccine is suitable for you or your family, talk to a doctor before seeking the wisdom of a random person on social media or television.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">What you do with your doctor’s counsel is up to you. That’s the point. It has nothing to do with me. If you decide not to follow your doctor’s advice, your choice does not obligate me to make the same decision spiritually.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
