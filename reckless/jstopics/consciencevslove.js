hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I have talked to people with strong opinions about wearing and not masks at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in America. The people who didn’t want to wear masks had arguments that seemed logical to them, and they were sincere. If I spoke to four people who didn’t want to wear masks, perhaps two got COVID-19 but had only mild symptoms. The other two didn’t get COVID-19 at all, to my knowledge. It is also true that as COVID-19 lingered in our society, our understanding of the virus grew exponentially more than when it first became headline news. There is debate about how effective masking is, at least how our initial masking practices were. I am not saying that masking is ineffective; I am saying there was always doubt coming from authoritative media sources regarding what we thought were settled facts about COVID–19.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">At any rate, I do think that one compelling aspect that my non-mask-wearing friends did not realize was that mask-wearing was a sacrificial way to show love for one’s neighbor. Even if mask-wearing does not eliminate the spread of respiratory viruses, it slows it considerably. It creates a safer space for those especially vulnerable, like the very young, the aged, and those with weak immune systems. Isn’t the safety of the least of these worth the inconvenience of wearing a mask in a public space?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><a id=\"spiritualcorrection\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Spiritual Correction<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I mentioned President Trump earlier in this message because fealty to the President to some citizens is so high that a commonsense dialogue about health and safety was not possible. Under the presidency of Trump, mask-wearing was a tool of liberals, and his Christian supporters elevated that concept to make mask-wearing a tool of Satan. Not only did this promote the kind of recklessness that the enemy tempted Christ with, but it made spiritual correction nearly impossible. The path back from this frenzy is for people to focus on God’s Word.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 4:12 King James Version (KJV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We see that one purpose of Scripture is to help us discern our true motives! We wouldn\'t have said many ridiculous statements about masks and vaccines in the body of Christ during the pandemic if we were more focused on the Word than politics. Why? The Word would have exposed to us our true intentions. If you peer into the world of sword making, you will find that it took craftsmen thousands of years to develop the art of making swords. Sword making is far more than melting iron, pouring it into a mold, and letting it cool. It requires decades of training to create a powerful and beautiful sword. Of course, blades were designed to cut. The Japanese sword is so sharp that the Katana can cut a copper pipe in half. The word of God cuts better than the finest sword because it does not cut merely our physical body. The word of God divides our soul and spirit to reveal our deepest thoughts and intents. This piercing is often painful and causes us to flinch or respond defensively.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 12:3<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">11 Christian Standard Bible (CSB)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">3 For consider him who endured such hostility from sinners against himself, so that you won’t grow weary and give up. 4 In struggling against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 5 And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">My son, do not take the Lord’s discipline lightly or lose heart when you are reproved by him,6 for the Lord disciplines the one he loves and punishes every son he receives.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">7 Endure suffering as discipline: God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline? 8 But if you are without discipline — which all receive — then you are illegitimate children and not sons. 9 Furthermore, we had human fathers discipline us, and we respected them. Shouldn’t we submit even more to the Father of spirits and live? 10 For they disciplined us for a short time based on what seemed good to them, but he does it for our benefit, so that we can share his holiness. 11 No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Word does not only cut; it purifies or corrects! God uses his Word as a rod of correction that we either receive or reject. Again, if we take this passage into context, the Hebrew Christians were about to make the ultimate reckless decision. Some were contemplating abandoning faith in Christ to revert to the sacrificial system of Moses to escape persecution. The letter of Hebrews was written to expose the complete folly and futility of that course of action! God uses life circumstances as instruments of correction also. However, we need God’s word to help us discern how God deals with us in life’s events. Consider the Lord’s message to Saul of Tarsus:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Acts 26:14 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">14 And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.’<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">A goad was a long stick with a sharp point on the end. Shepherds and farmers used it to herd livestock. If a shepherd wanted to herd an animal one way, but the animal wanted to go a different way, the shepherd would poke the animal with the goad. If the animal stubbornly resisted and kicked at the goad, it would stab itself against the point. Eventually, the beast would get the message — follow the shepherd.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Jesus employed different goads to herd Saul of Tarsus toward salvation and service. As Paul was a contemporary of Jesus, he might have heard some of his messages, at least through his Pharisee instructors. It may have been the witness of the Christians he persecuted, such as Stephen. It was his conscience bearing witness that Jesus was the Messiah. Whatever the goads, every time Saul persecuted the church and raged against the teaching of Jesus, he was stabbing or doing violence to his conscience. Saul’s only rational option was to surrender to the grace of God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Although Paul’s experience with God’s spiritual goads was dramatic, as believers, we experience God’s goads regularly. When we read the word of God\'s word, the talk will prick our conscience at some point. The lifestyle and commitment we see in other believers may convict us to change our ways. But the Lord has another goad he employs. Pastors who preach to and teach God’s flock are a goad or an instrument of correction in God’s hand. Paul told Timothy that 2\/​3 of his preaching ministry would be correcting God’s people:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Timothy 4:2 King James Version (KJV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">As I taught before, “reprove” and “rebuke” are strong words. They mean “sharp correction.” Taken more broadly, the Greek word pictures for preaching and ministry gifts convey the idea of getting a slap in the face. Not a physical slap, of course, but the effect of the preached word can be as if someone is slapping you in the face. Not a pleasant feeling.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In Bible school, I wasn’t trained in rebuking people. I was trained on how to study to Word and exegete Scripture. I learned that when you preach the word of God, the Word has a life of its own. As the term is preached, it goes forth and does what it does in conjunction with the Holy Spirit. And most of that is to correct, reprove and rebuke believers so they can live in a way that pleases the Master.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><a id=\"christianswithitchingears\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Christians with Itching Ears<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">One characteristic of Christians with itching ears is that they accumulate Bible teachers. They spend time sorting through Bible teachers to find those that agree with their positions on assorted topics and add them to their collection. They have a Bible teacher for divorce, a Bible teacher for creation, a Bible teacher for speaking in tongues, a different one for women in the ministry, a different one for social justice and so on.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Another characteristic of Christians with itching ears is that they are quickly taken in by myths. Our contemporary American society has entire industries devoted to producing and selling myths to Christians. One set of tales is conspiracy theories on themes like one world government, secret organizations, numerology, the mark of the Beast and the like.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Other mythmakers are those who weave American history into the Christian faith to create this civic religion. Many Christians cannot discern the difference between the Christian and American religions.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">This embrace of false teachers and preposterous myths results from rejecting the truth, which is hard to receive. Some people would rather be deceived than change!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><a id=\"ichargeyoubeforegod\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">&quot;I Charge You Before God&quot;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">You will note that when Paul is writing Timothy and Titus, he uses the phrase, “I charge you in the presence of God . . . ” For example, consider this verse:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">1 Timothy 5:19<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">21 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">19 Do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. 20 As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all so that the rest may stand in fear. 21 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging, doing nothing from partiality.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">This is harsh language. Paul reminds his disciples that the Godhead and the mighty angels are carefully observing their pastoral ministry. First, you cannot entertain mere hearsay against an elder. But if there are two or three witnesses, and they persist in sin (meaning they do not repent and refuse to change their ways), they are to be publicly rebuked. Why would Paul charge Timothy to do this in the presence of God, Jesus, and the elect angels?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Because being an impartial instrument of God’s correction is extremely difficult for any person to do. I have heard that one of the most vital human impulses is to be liked, accepted, and included. One of the quickest ways to be rejected is to call out people’s sins. If you have a word-based preaching or teaching ministry that constantly reproves, rebukes, and corrects<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> you won’t have many people like you. Over time, they could be a temptation to back off from that kind of preaching and make it more palatable. Or to talk about sins that don’t apply to the people in your congregation. If the people in your church are Democrats, they preach against Republicans. If they are Baptists, preach against Presbyterians. Paul is warning Timothy that if you show partiality in his preaching, he will have to deal with God, Jesus, and the elect angels!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Every pastor has to be reminded that we are working for God and not a<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">man!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I learned that because God’s truth is often painful to receive, people lash out in defense of the messenger. Another thing they do is to get out from under the intense pressure of the true Word and seek out Bible teachers that preach a more comfortable and pleasing Word. Note what Paul wrote to Timothy.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Timothy 4:1<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">4 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">4 I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: 2 preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. 3 For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, 4 and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Note a few things. When Paul talks about people having itching ears, he talks about Christians in the local church. These Christians cannot accept being corrected with sound doctrine, so they find teachers who will tell them what they want to hear the way they want to listen to it. There is this human element in the pastoral epistles that I can relate to. As a pastor, I don’t enjoy telling adults who have been in the church for years that having sexual relations outside the marriage covenant is wrong. In my flesh, I would prefer not to be the vessel to have to correct saints, some who may have been saved longer than I have been alive, that a shepherd has responsibility for all of God’s house, not some of God’s house, and will answer to God for everything that happens in Gods house. But the thing is, I am a bondservant of Christ, or at least I want to be. So that means I am not in charge of my ministry. I don’t choose my assignments; I don’t choose my messages in that sense; my responsibility is to be obedient to the Master to the best of my ability.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><a id=\"theanonymoussower\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">The Anonymous Sower<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Here is the final thought. One of the most famous parables of Jesus is the parable is the sower (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Mark+4%3A1-20&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"weblink\">Mark 4:1–20<\/a>). The reason is that Jesus said inverse 13 <\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">that understanding this parable was the key to understanding all other parables. In verse 3, Jesus said, “A sower went out to sow.” What is interesting is that they do not know the sower’s name. We do not know his skin color or nationality. We do not know where he went to school or how many degrees he had. We do not know if he was short or tall, slim or fat or anything about him. Why? It’s not essential. The work of the sower is necessary, but the sower\'s identity<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">is not. <\/span><\/p>\n\r"
