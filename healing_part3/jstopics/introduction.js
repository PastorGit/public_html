In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!” 7 And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. 8 And leaping up, he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God, 10 and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">11 While he clung to Peter and John, all the people, utterly astounded, ran together to them in the portico called Solomon’s. 12 And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: “Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk? 13 The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. 14 But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, 15 and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. 16 And his name—by faith in his name—has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">17 “And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. 18 But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled. 19 Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out, 20 that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, 21 whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago. 22 Moses said, ‘The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you. 23 And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.’ 24 And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came after him, also proclaimed these days. 25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’ 26 God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<\/td>\n\r<\/tr>\n\r<\/table>\n\r<\/div>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In our healing series, we have been looking at the origin of divine healing. Jesus of Nazareth is the healer, and healing is the result of his redemptive work. Therefore, divine healing is essential to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Also, believers receive healing through faith in Jesus Christ. We do not receive healing based on our good works or the power of man\'s righteousness.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The text passage in Acts 3 is an excellent case study on how divine healing works. In this scripture, God heals a man crippled from birth. This healing was total, permanent and supernatural. Indeed, Peter said that the disabled man received perfect health. This statement could mean one of two things. The first meaning is that God perfectly healed the man’s legs and feet. The other interpretation is that God healed the man of all his ailments and weaknesses. For example, this man was so helpless that he had to be carried everywhere from birth and was reduced to being a beggar. He might have had corresponding emotional problems due to his condition. God delivered him from all of his sickness and weakness.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">God did this act of healing in the presence of bystanders. This healing gave Peter and John a perfect opportunity to preach the Gospel. The Father wanted to demonstrate the power in the name of Jesus openly. Consider this Scripture:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<div style=\"text-align: left; text-indent: 0; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0.6875rem 3.0000rem 0.2500rem 3.0000rem;\"><table style=\"border:none;border-spacing:0;padding:0;line-height: normal;\"><tr style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><td style=\"border:none;padding:0;width:1.1250rem\"><img id=\"toggle0186a2_ICON\" class=\"dropdown-toggle-icon\" alt=\"hmtoggle_plus0\" style=\"margin:0;width:0.5625rem;height:0.5625rem;border:none\" src=\".\/images\/hmtoggle_plus0.gif\"\/><\/td><td style=\"border:none;padding:0\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"><a id=\"toggle0186a2_LINK\" class=\"dropdown-toggle\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-type=\"dropdown\" data-state=\"0\" data-icon=\"toggle0186a2_ICON\" data-src0=\".\/images\/hmtoggle_plus0.gif\" data-src1=\".\/images\/hmtoggle_plus1.gif\">Ephesians 3:1-13<\/a><\/span><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/div>\n\r<div id=\"toggle0186a2\" class=\"dropdown-toggle-body\" style=\"text-align: left; text-indent: 0; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0.6875rem 3.0000rem 0.2500rem 3.0000rem;display:none\"><table style=\"border:none; border-spacing:0;\">\n\r<tr>\n\r<td style=\"vertical-align:top; padding:0; border:none\"><p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Ephesians 3:1–13 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">3 For this reason I, Paul, &nbsp;a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles— 2 assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you, &nbsp;3 how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, &nbsp;as I have written briefly. 4 When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, &nbsp;5 which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. 6 This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, &nbsp;members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the Gospel.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">7 Of this Gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God’s grace, which was given me by the working of his power. 8 To me, &nbsp;though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, &nbsp;to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, &nbsp;9 and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, &nbsp;who created all things, &nbsp;10 so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. 11 This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, &nbsp;12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him. 13 So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you, &nbsp;which is your glory.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<\/td>\n\r<\/tr>\n\r<\/table>\n\r<\/div>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">The Father’s plan is to declare through the Church the immutability of his holy wisdom to principalities and powers.

(Cross reference Col 2:11-15 <a href=\"scripture-list.html#colossians21115phillips\" class=\"topiclink\">Phillips<\/a> and <a href=\"scripture-list.html#colossians21415exb\" class=\"topiclink\">Expanded Bible<\/a> versions).<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span class=\"f_bullet\">Do we see the picture? The cross of Jesus is a symbol of victory. At the cross, the Father broke death’s power over our lives and shattered the reign of Satan over the nations. Notably, the Father publicly paraded his demon enemies before the entire universe like a general parading his enemies as caged captives in a victory parade. The importance of this characteristic of God the Father—that he likes to display his power openly—is why we should not be ashamed to pray for divine healing.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><a id=\"madepossiblebychrist\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Made Possible by Christ<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In Colossians, Paul teaches us that our salvation rests on the crucifixion of Christ because, on the cross, Jesus bore the entirety of our sins and erased our sin debt. As we learned last Sunday, the resurrection is the Father’s validation of Jesus’s sacrifice on the cross, divine proof that the Father was satisfied by Jesus’s sacrifice. Because Jesus of Nazareth was sinless, death had no right to hold him. God the Father raised Jesus from the dead and appointed him as Lord and Christ, the divine God and Sovereign over all, whose reign will never end.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The term “cross” refers to the entire arc of suffering from the Garden of Gethsemane to death on the cross. Through the cross, Jesus also redeemed us from the curse of the Law. The curse of Law, explained in Deuteronomy 28, is spiritual death, poverty, and sickness on earth. In raising Jesus, the Father declared that Jesus’s sacrifice eternally secured our healing. Therefore, the cross secures our freedom from sin and subsequent justification and our healing.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><a id=\"notbypowerofpiety\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Not by Power of Piety<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Therefore, when Peter says, &quot;by what power or piety has this man been made whole,&quot; he emphasizes that neither his holiness nor his spiritual power healed the crippled man. Instead, the man was healed because of faith in the name of Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In our following message, we will talk more about the name of Jesus. In this message, we focus on the limitation of human power and holiness because there is an application for our congregation.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Black people love titles. I believe our fascination with honorifics is part of our genetic memory, harkening back to when Africans were the proud rulers of vast kingdoms. Africans, it seems, gravitate toward a tribal leader leadership model. The great, ancient kingdoms are no more, but the instinct to tribalize is very much alive in the hearts and minds of black people worldwide. Much as it would be in any potentate, assigning titles in the black church is serious business.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Indeed, true to our nature, we add color and flavor to titles in the black church. Visit the thousands of black churches in the New York City area, and there you will encounter a colorful and creative display of colorful markers, including mothers in Zion, presiding elders, first apostles, head deacons, elect Ladies, rabbis, bishops, armor bearers, spiritual fathers and most reverend doctors.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I am having fun with this tendency but not making fun of it. It is appropriate for the black community to celebrate and even advertise the positive accomplishments of our brethren. Additionally, we use honorifics as a sign of affection and respect. Title bearing in the black church is a way for black people to affirm our community’s dignity and honor despite being historically disrespected in society.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">However, problems when we start thinking that having a title imputes spiritual tenure, wisdom and power. Aside from the authentic biblical titles set aside for those in the New Testament church, made-up titles are devoid of spiritual authority. While they serve a social purpose, <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">they don’t validate <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">a person’s holiness or spiritual power.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When we become clear-eyed about honorifics’ use and limitations, we will have removed an obstacle to receiving healing. What causes us to be healed is the prayer offered in faith in the finished work of Jesus, not a person with a colorful title. Let’s consider a portion of the text:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">6 But Peter said, “I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">16 And his name—by faith in his name—has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We can see that faith in the name of Jesus healed the man, not trust in the title that Peter or John held or in their holiness or power. Let’s look at another Scripture:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<div style=\"text-align: left; text-indent: 0; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0.6875rem 3.0000rem 0.2500rem 3.0000rem;\"><table style=\"border:none;border-spacing:0;padding:0;line-height: normal;\"><tr style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><td style=\"border:none;padding:0;width:1.1250rem\"><img id=\"toggle0186a4_ICON\" class=\"dropdown-toggle-icon\" alt=\"hmtoggle_plus0\" style=\"margin:0;width:0.5625rem;height:0.5625rem;border:none\" src=\".\/images\/hmtoggle_plus0.gif\"\/><\/td><td style=\"border:none;padding:0\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"><a id=\"toggle0186a4_LINK\" class=\"dropdown-toggle\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-type=\"dropdown\" data-state=\"0\" data-icon=\"toggle0186a4_ICON\" data-src0=\".\/images\/hmtoggle_plus0.gif\" data-src1=\".\/images\/hmtoggle_plus1.gif\">James 5:13–18<\/a><\/span><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/div>\n\r<div id=\"toggle0186a4\" class=\"dropdown-toggle-body\" style=\"text-align: left; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0.6875rem 3.0000rem 0.2500rem 4.1250rem;display:none\"><table style=\"border:none; border-spacing:0;\">\n\r<tr>\n\r<td style=\"vertical-align:top; padding:0; border:none\"><p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">James 5:13–18 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">13 Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. 16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working. 17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. 18 Then he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth bore its fruit.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<\/td>\n\r<\/tr>\n\r<\/table>\n\r<\/div>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">There is a lot to this scripture, but let me break it down. Part of the elder’s responsibility is to pray for the sick. But notice it is not the fact that they are elders that contributes to healing. Verse 15 tells us that the prayer of faith brings healing. Verse 16 tells us that strife and non-forgiveness can block us from receiving healing. Verse 17 emphasizes that ordinary people can pray an effective prayer of faith and Elijah prayed. Verse 18 tells us that not all healing is instantaneous and immediate. Healing can take time to manifest.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">In verse 14, the Word says that we should call for the church’s elders, which is plural. In other words, this is not merely the domain of the pastor. All elders should be able to pray the prayer of faith in the name of the Lord. All the elders should be able to see the fruit of healing in their ministries.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">One reason “elders” is plural is that there is spiritual power in numbers. Jesus sent his disciples out two by two <\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> (<a href=\"scripture-list.html#mark67\" class=\"topiclink\">Mark 6:7<\/a>). <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">When the whole church prayed, the building shook <\/span><span class=\"f_body\"><a href=\"scripture-list.html#acts431\" class=\"topiclink\">Acts 4:31<\/a>).<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\"> However, the numbers do not cause us to be healed. It is the prayer of faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><a id=\"conclusion\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Conclusion<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The critical point is that people’s power or righteousness does not heal us. You don’t have to have a bishop pray for you to be healed. You don’t have to have a prophet pray for you to be healed.  <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">Healing comes to us by faith in the name of Jesus, not by having a pious person with a title pray for you. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Second, and related, <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">neither your purity nor spiritual power will get you healed. <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">God isn’t going to heal you because you fast every week, pray for an hour every day, tithe to the very penny, and go to church during a pandemic. Those may be holy things to do, but your behavior does not impress God or earn you healing. Healing is received by faith, not by your good deeds of piety.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Third, God will not heal you because many people are praying for you. If every church member in the country went on a 40-day fast for your healing but did not believe you were healed, after 40 days, we would have a lot of hungry church people and one dead saint. Healing is received by faith in the name of Jesus, not by the number of people praying for you.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Hopefully, God is clearing up some of the confusion around divine healing. If you have wondered why certain people you cared about didn’t receive healing, perhaps the Lord is shedding light on your thinking. We can see that not understanding how to receive healing by faith and not understanding the meaning and necessity of praying in the name of Jesus often are missing ingredients to being healed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Don’t despair. Keep tuning in, and you will learn what faith is and how to pray in the name of Jesus with understanding. And you will start seeing results in your life and the lives of those for whom you pray.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_close\"><span class=\"f_close\">In the name of God, &nbsp;Amen.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_close\"><span class=\"f_close\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
