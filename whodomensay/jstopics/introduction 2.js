And on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” 28 And they told him, “John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.” 29 And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.” 30 And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">31 And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. 32 And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 33 But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">Who Do People Say That I Am?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Jesus was interested in what people said about him then, and he is interested in what people are saying about him today. What do men today say about Jesus? Most people in western culture speak of Jesus in the past tense. Some say he was a great teacher. Some say he was the founder of Christianity. Some say even acknowledge he was a prophet. Some scholars refer to him as the historical Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Next, Jesus &nbsp;asked his disciples who <\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">they<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> said he was. Now by this time, the disciples had been walking and talking with Jesus for some time. They had listened to his teaching and seen his miracles. Even so, only one disciple spoke up. Peter, who was often talking, said Jesus was the Christ. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The word &quot;Christ&quot; is a title. It literally means<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\"> anointed one<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">. To <\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">anoint<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> means to cover or smear with oil. In ancient Jewish culture, candidates for the prophet, priest and king office were anointed with sacred oil as a sign that they were consecrated for the Lord\'s service. Oil was a physical symbol of the Holy Spirit. &nbsp;The pouring of the oil on that person was an acknowledgment that God had place his Holy Spirit on that person. Aaron, Saul and David are examples of people who were anointed by God and through religious ceremony.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In Hebrew parlance, the term, <\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Anointed One,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> referred to the Messiah, a coming Savior who would have a special anointing from God to deliver Israel from their sins and their enemies. The English word for that the Anointed One is Christ. So, &quot;Christ&quot; is not Jesus\'s last name, it is his title. It is more appropriate to say Christ Jesus or Jesus the Christ, but we shorten the title and simply say, &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot; <\/span><\/p>\n\r"
