hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">After Peter\'s declaration, Jesus teaches his disciples from the he is going suffer, be murdered and rise again after three days. Matthew, Mark and Luke both record this account (See Matthew 16:21, Luke 9:21). In other passages, it is clear that Jesus taught his disciples that his suffering, death and resurrection from Scripture:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Luke 24:25<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">27 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">25 And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 26 Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” 27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">1 Corinthians 15:1<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">5 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">15 Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, 2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Now as a reminder, the Scriptures we are referring to is primarily what you and I would call the Old Testament, because the New Testament hadnot been collected. Again, we call that Bible the Old Testament. By the way, the term, &quot;Old Testament&quot; is not derogatory. As Christians, we are not demeaning Judaism by calling referring to the Law of Moses as the Old Testament. We are simply agreeing with God that that provisional covenant has been fulfilled in Christ, has passed away, and is therefore is no longer necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">It is inappropriate to refer to the Law as the first testament, because it was not God\'s first covenant with man. There are many testaments or covenants recorded in the Old Testament, starting in the Garden of Eden. Indeed, with respect to salvation, God\'s first covenant with man pointed to Jesus as a seed and was fulfilled at Calvary. <\/span><\/p>\n\r"
