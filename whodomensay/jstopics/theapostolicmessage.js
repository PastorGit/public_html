We should make it our goal to understand the life and mission of Jesus from Scripture. Now let\'s see how this Bible study that Jesus gave his disciples played out. Let\'s look at Acts 2 where Peter gives a sermon on the day of Pentecost:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Acts 2:22<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">36 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">22 “Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know— 23 this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. 24 God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. 25 For David says concerning him,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">“‘I saw the Lord always before me,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">26 therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;my flesh also will dwell in hope.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">27 For you will not abandon my soul to Hades,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;or let your Holy One see corruption.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">28 You have made known to me the paths of life;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">29 “Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 30 Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, 31 he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. 32 This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. 33 Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. 34 For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">“‘The Lord said to my Lord,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">“Sit at my right hand,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">35 &nbsp; &nbsp; until I make your enemies your footstool.”’<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">36 Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Now we are only looking at a portion of Peter\'s great sermon. In that sermon, Peter quotes liberally from the Old Testament. In the passage we read, Peter is quote from Psalm 16 and Psalm 110. Let\'s turn to these Psalms so you can see it for yourself:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Psalm 16:8<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">11 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">8 I have set the Lord always before me;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;my flesh also dwells secure.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">10 For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;or let your holy one see corruption.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">11 You make known to me the path of life;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;in your presence there is fullness of joy;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">And then Psalm 110:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Psalm 110:1 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">A Psalm of David.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">110 The Lord says to my Lord:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;“Sit at my right hand,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">until I make your enemies your footstool.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">The Source of Peter\'s Interpretation<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Peter is stating that these Psalms are speaking of Jesus of Nazareth. However, you will note that neither Psalm 16 or Psalm 110 mention the name, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth.&quot; So how does Peter know that David is writing about Jesus of Nazareth versus another person? Because Jesus meticulously went through all the Scriptures and showed how they pointed to him, and then after being raised from the dead offered numerous, infallible proofs that he was God in fulfillment of Scripture:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Acts 1:1-3 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">1 In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach, 2 until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. 3 He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">The Gift of Faith<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Someone said,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\"> &quot;Well, I don\'t believe Peter got it right&quot; <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">We must realize that faith is a gift. We can\'t make people believe anything. When I was a undergraduate, I took some religious courses, including a course in the Old Testament. The professor was a distinguished scholar. He stated it was wrong for people to believe that Isaiah 53 referred to Jesus Christ. He argued that Isaiah was actually writing about an ancient king who died a horrible death. My professor did not believe that Jesus was God. He didn\'t believe he was Messiah or Savior according to the Scriptures. However, Jesus and the Apostles said that Isaiah 53 referred to Jesus. As an undergraduate, I had a choice to either believe Jesus\'s Bible study or my professor\'s Bible study. &nbsp;I chose to believe Jesus. I believe not because I am the better man, but because God favored me with faith. God gave me the faith to believe; he <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">allowed<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> me to believe.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Note there is a connection between believing and hearing the Word of God. When Peter preached the Word of God, the people believed and repented. I don\'t think Peter\'s gender, nationality, or marital status were primary factors here. I think it was the Word of God that brought about repentance. <\/span><\/p>\n\r"
