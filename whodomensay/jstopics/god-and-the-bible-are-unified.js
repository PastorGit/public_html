hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Law of Moses is fulfilled and the God\'s covenant at Mt. Sinai has passed away, <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">but the Old Testament is not canceled. <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">The Bible is a unified book containing what we call the Old and New Testaments. The God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament are the same God. The Jews in the days of Abraham and Moses and Jesus day had an unshakeable belief in monotheism. They believed that God was one Lord. The Apostles used Old Testament Scriptures to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was the incarnation of God the Son, the Son being the inseparable essence of God the Father. Let me give you an example. In Acts 2, Peter quotes Psalm 110:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Psalm 110:1 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">A Psalm of David.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">110 The Lord says to my Lord:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;“Sit at my right hand,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">until I make your enemies your footstool.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If you were to do a study on the word &quot;Lord&quot; you would see that the word traces back to the Hebrew word that we pronounce &quot;Yahweh.&quot; The word was so sacred that ancient Hebrews dared not to speak it. The &nbsp;Greek word for Yahweh, is &quot;Kurios.&quot; Peter is attributing the title of Yahweh to Jesus of Nazareth and does so more than once in his sermon on Pentecost. At the same time he distinguishes Jesus from the Son, as the Apostle John does masterfully in the first chapter of his Gospel. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When Peter says that God raised Jesus up from the dead, well he is making a distinction between God the Father and Jesus of Nazareth. When he says, whomever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved (<a href=\"scripture-list2.html#acts221\" class=\"topiclink\">Acts 2:21<\/a>), he is talking about calling upon the name of Jesus. But in making that statement he is quoting the prophet Joel (<a href=\"scripture-list2.html#joel232\" class=\"topiclink\">Joel 2:23<\/a>), who was referring to Jehovah, or the one true God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Monotheism, The Trinity and Jesus Christ<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">As a local congregation, it is our responsibility to understand who Jesus is. We must understand the we are monotheists who believe in the Trinity and emphatically assert that Jesus of Nazareth is the incarnation of the Son who always was and always will be God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r"
