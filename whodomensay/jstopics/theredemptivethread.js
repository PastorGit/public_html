hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Let\'s talk this through. Jesus gives his apostles (including Paul) a lesson from the Old Testament teaching them about his messianic work. He emphasizes how his suffering, death, burial and resurrection are documented in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms. After Jesus ascends to heaven and takes his place at the Father\'s right hand, the Apostles preach this message, which we call the Gospel. Eventually their sermons, letters and thoughts are written down and collected and called the New Testament.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The New Testament writings are replete with quotations from the Old Testament, especially pointing to the work of Jesus Christ. Acts 2 is a excellent example of this trend. Modern versions of the Bible, such as the New International Version do an a good job of indicating when the New Testament authors are quoting Old Testament sources. When reading a modern version, you can see how frequently the Old Testament is referenced in the New Testament, and how often these references refer to Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">What can we as a local church take from this information?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">God and the Bible are Unified<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Law of Moses is fulfilled and the God\'s covenant at Mt. Sinai has passed away, <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">but the Old Testament is not canceled. <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">The Bible is a unified book containing what we call the Old and New Testaments. The God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament are the same God. The Jews in the days of Abraham and Moses and Jesus day had an unshakeable belief in monotheism. They believed that God was one Lord. The Apostles used Old Testament Scriptures to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was the incarnation of God the Son, the Son being the inseparable essence of God the Father. Let me give you an example. In Acts 2, Peter quotes Psalm 110:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Psalm 110:1 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">A Psalm of David.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">110 The Lord says to my Lord:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"> &nbsp; &nbsp;“Sit at my right hand,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">until I make your enemies your footstool.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If you were to do a study on the word &quot;Lord&quot; you would see that the word traces back to the Hebrew word that we pronounce &quot;Yahweh.&quot; The word was so sacred that ancient Hebrews dared not to speak it. The &nbsp;Greek word for Yahweh, is &quot;Kurios.&quot; Peter is attributing the title of Yahweh to Jesus of Nazareth and does so more than once in his sermon on Pentecost. At the same time he distinguishes Jesus from the Son, as the Apostle John does masterfully in the first chapter of his Gospel. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When Peter says that God raised Jesus up from the dead, well he is making a distinction between God the Father and Jesus of Nazareth. When he says, whomever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved (<a href=\"scriptureindexforwhodomensaythatiam.html#acts221\" class=\"topiclink\">Acts 2:21<\/a>), he is talking about calling upon the name of Jesus. But in making that statement he is quoting the prophet Joel (<a href=\"scriptureindexforwhodomensaythatiam.html#joel232\" class=\"topiclink\">Joel 2:23<\/a>), who was referring to Jehovah, or the one true God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Monotheism, The Trinity and Jesus Christ<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">As a local congregation, it is our responsibility to understand who Jesus is. We must understand the we are monotheists who believe in the Trinity and emphatically assert that Jesus of Nazareth is the incarnation of the Son who always was and always will be God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">The Primary Purpose of the Old Testament<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_body\">First, the Church should not be embarrassed by the Old Testament and seek to undermine its authority. Second, we must understand that the Old Testament primarily should points to Jesus Christ. Third, we must understand the Jesus of Nazareth perfectly fulfills the Old Testament. As believers, we are not called to live according to bits and pieces of the Law of Moses. As believers we are not to extract parts of the Law of Moses to apply to our lives, our communities, to unbelievers, to modern day Israel or to the world. Fourth, as believers, we should understand the apostolic teachings of the New Testament guides us in what specific Old Testament principles and precepts to adopt and how. Put more simply, we don\'t commit murder because murder is condemned in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. We don\'t bother with animal sacrifice because the New Testament reveals that it is no longer necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">There is a lot at stake with how to correctly apply the Old Testament as a Christian. Wrongly applying the Old Testament will not only lead to spiritual confusion and spiritual bondage but will destroy the local church. The most infamous heresy that nearly destroyed the early church was rooted in an incorrect understanding of applying the Mosaic Law. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
