hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I can testify that you will enjoy your Christian life more when you focus your thoughts and study on the life and work of Jesus of Nazareth as articulated in Scripture. In American Christianity, there is a subtle movement to study the Bible through the lens of self-gratification. That is to say, &quot;what can I get out of the Bible? How can Christianity make me happy?&quot; There are many variations of this kind of thinking, but in the end it is all based on self.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I want to tread carefully here, because I do not want to unnecessarily criticize ministers or call into question what God has called other preachers to do. However, in aggregate, I believe much American Bible study and preaching is not the pursuit of understanding the revelation of Jesus in the entirety of the Bible. Rather in aggregate, the pursuit of American Bible study and preaching is focused on acquiring<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\"> other things<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> that most immediately gratify human beings. When we shift our thinking away from ourselves to the glory of Jesus of Nazareth and his finished work, we will experience divine peace, joy, fulfillment, love and miracles.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><a id=\"divinepeace\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Divine Peace<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">We will experience divine peace because we will continually be reminded that Father God loves and accepts us based on the merit and perfection of Jesus, not our behavior or good works. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">We will have peace knowing that Father God will meet our needs because of Jesus and therefore will not become anxious or envious when others prosper.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">We will have peace knowing our salvation is secure in Christ.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><a id=\"divinejoy\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Divine Joy<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Growing in the knowledge of Jesus is a continual feast. It is like drawing from a well of cool, refreshing water and drinking deeply from it on a terribly hot day. The scriptural truths of Jesus never grow old or become boring. On the other hand, a selfish, self-centered approach to the Bible where one is always trying to scheme to get God to do this or that becomes dissatisfying quickly and leads to backsliding. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">People who meditate on the redemptive work of Jesus as revealed in Scripture have an inexplicable joy that radiates from their spirit and sustains them during dark of times. This joy will carry them all the way to the glory of the next life. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">In BWCC, we are blessed to have mature believers, who although they have suffered much, lead by example in their love for Christ and their divine joy. Their songs, their prayers, their laughter spread the joy of the Lord throughout our family. I esteem these blessed saints in the Lord very highly. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><a id=\"divinefulfillment\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Divine Fulfillment<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">As we meditate and grow in our love and appreciation for Jesus Christ, we find fulfillment and mission for our own lives. By understanding Jesus\'s work, we can more clearly see our life\'s purpose. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><a id=\"divinelove\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Divine Love<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Meditating on the life and work of Jesus expands our capacity to love all people and especially our brothers and sisters in Christ. It is impossible to have a mature view of the cross, and harbor resentment and bitterness toward those for whom Christ died. May we all learn how to lay down our grudges and bitterness and open our hearts to one another in Christ. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">The good news is walking divine love is as natural to a Christian as swimming is to a fish.<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\"> It takes relatively minor adjustments to put on a love mindset and become compassionate and sympathetic toward your church family. Try it!

The more we trust Jesus\'s words, the more Father God wants to make those words come to pass in our lives in custom ways. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Spend some time meditating on a Christ-centered word and then ask God to do something big in your life: restore and refresh your marriage, draw your children closer to you, bless you financially, drive out sickness from your body, bless you with a better job. Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_close\"><span class=\"f_close\">In the name of God, Amen<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
