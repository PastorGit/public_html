That means that Jesus of Nazareth is in heaven, seated at the right hand of the Father. Many church icons portray Jesus with his head hung down, wearing a crown of thorns, nailed to a cross. These visuals are accurate, <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">but they are also past tense<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">. Jesus is no longer on the cross, and he is no longer in the tomb. No, Jesus is raised, and he is ascended.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Hebrews 1:1-3 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">1 Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, 2 but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. 3 He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">That is a very different picture of an emaciated Jesus hanging from the cross or lying in a tomb!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">The writer is talking about Jesus of Nazareth, whom he calls the “exact imprint of God’s nature.” The writer of Hebrews is making this point: <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Jesus of Nazareth is resurrected, and he is God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">The second point to consider is that Jesus finished his work of cleansing us from sins. This work is <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">complete and finished.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> Jesus did not die for sins up until you came along. Your sins are not unique or special. Your sins are included in the finished work of Christ.

The Father requires that every person verbally acknowledge that they receive this reality as freely offered to them.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
