Although they are not devout, they like Jesus and want to honor his memory. They may have a picture of Jesus in their office or a cross hanging from the rear-view window of their car. They may have a laminated prayer or laminated picture of Jesus in their purse or wallet. Maybe they wear a cross on a chain or perhaps a cross tattooed on their body. From time to time, they go to a church to remember how wonderful Jesus was.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">However, our trinkets, jewelry and tattoos are useless if we fail to recognize that Jesus is risen.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Friends, Easter is not about remembering a great moral teacher who founded Christianity and died tragically. Easter is a celebration of a risen Savior, who did indeed die—he died for our sins—but who is no longer in the grave, no longer in a tomb, but risen and alive and seated at the right hand of the Father.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
