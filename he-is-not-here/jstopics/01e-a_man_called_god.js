Moreover, if that person started traveling from church to church, making such a claim, church authorities would do everything to discredit that person and their ministry.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">The difference, of course, is that Jesus <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">proved<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> he was God and the religious authorities who resisted his message did so because they were consumed by hate and rage. This evil culminated in a plot to kill Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Although the Jewish authorities wanted Jesus dead, he did not die until Jesus fulfilled his mission allowed himself to be arrested and crucified. After Jesus died on the cross, a wealthy Jewish leader named Joseph of Arimathea had the body of Jesus placed in his tomb.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Matthew 27:55-66 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">55 There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, 56 among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">57 When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. 58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud 60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. 61 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">62 The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate 63 and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise.’ 64 Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first.” 65 Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.” 66 So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">So now we come to this part of Luke. The women from Galilee are coming to embalm the body of Jesus. These women expected they could convince the Roman soldiers to pity them and let them embalm the body of Jesus. However, they had not considered how they were going to roll the stone from the mouth of the tomb.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
