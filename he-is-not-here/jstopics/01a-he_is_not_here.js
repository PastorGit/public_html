Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,7 that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.” 8 And they remembered his words, 9 and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Hebrews 9: 12, 15-17 Easy-to-Read Version (ERV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">12 Christ entered the Most Holy Place only one time—enough for all time. He entered the Most Holy Place by using his own blood, not the blood of goats or young bulls.

He brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by God can have the blessings God promised, blessings that last forever. This can happen only because Christ died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">16 When someone dies and leaves a will, there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead. 17 A will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living.

For three-plus years, Jesus of Nazareth had been preaching to the Jews in Israel the good news of a coming kingdom, and the good news that God was forgiving sins and setting men free from darkness and despair. He evidenced his message by consistently and frequently performing miracles such as healing all manner of sicknesses, exorcising demons, showing love and giving hope to those who were downtrodden and lost in sin.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.8750rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.20rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Although Jesus was a perfect man, he had many enemies, particularly religious authorities who resisted the notion that Jesus was the Son of God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
