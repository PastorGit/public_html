However, it is also unexceptional because Jesus does what he typically does: heal the sick and perform miracles. If we look at the Gospel collectively, the focus of Jesus’s ministry was preaching the Gospel, healing the sick and performing miracles.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Believers ought to ask themselves why the Lord was so intent on healing. One answer is found in Luke 4:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><a id=\"luke41819englishstandardversionesv\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Luke 4:18–19 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">18 “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\"> because he has anointed me<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\"> to proclaim good news to the poor.<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\"> and recovering of sight to the blind,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\"> to set at liberty those who are oppressed,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">19 to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In this passage, Jesus explains why he healed people. The Holy Spirit was upon him and anointed him to do Father’s work, including healing. That was part of his mission and mandate. We can and should go deeper into the healing ministry of Christ. Why was ministering divine healing so central to Jesus’s mission and an essential aspect of the Father’s plan? The answer to this level of questioning is found in Matthew 8:16–17:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><a id=\"matthew81617newkingjamesversionnkjv\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Matthew 8:16–17 New King James Version (NKJV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">16 When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">“He Himself took our infirmities<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">And bore our sicknesses.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Matthew is quoting Isaiah. So let’s look at the passage in Isaiah.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><a id=\"isaiah5345englishstandardversionesv\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Isaiah 53:4–5 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">4 Surely he has borne our griefs<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\"> and carried our sorrows;<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">yet we esteemed him stricken,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\"> smitten by God, and afflicted.<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">5 But he was pierced for our transgressions;<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\"> he was crushed for our iniquities;<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\"> and with his wounds we are healed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Looking at the healing ministry of Jesus from the lens of prophecy will help us appreciate the wonder and depth of God’s redemptive plan. To reiterate a point I have made previously, let’s look at Luke 24 and Acts 1:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><a id=\"luke2427englishstandardversionesv\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Luke 24:27 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><a id=\"acts13englishstandardversionesv\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Acts 1:3 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">3 He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">These Scriptures tell us that we must understand what the Old Testament says about Jesus to understand Jesus and his ministry. Jesus taught his apostles from the Old Testament scriptures, including Isaiah, the meaning of his ministry and message. Eventually, the Apostles and others wrote down what Jesus taught them. This collection of writings is called the New Testament. Therefore, New Testament references to Old Testament passages are probably about Jesus’s life or ministry.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><a id=\"griefsvs.sicknesses\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Griefs vs. Sicknesses<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Some English translations of Isaiah, including the King James Version, do not translate the Hebrew text saying that the Messiah took up our infirmities and bore our sicknesses. Instead, these versions translate that the Messiah bore our <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">griefs<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> and <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">sorrows<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">. This translation has an entirely different meaning to English speakers. However, some English versions are closer to Matthew’s interpretation. For example, consider the NET Bible translation of Isaiah 53:4:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Isaiah 53:4–5 New English Translation (NET Bible)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">4 But he lifted up our illnesses,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">he carried our pain;<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">even though we thought he was being punished,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">attacked by God, and afflicted for something he had done.<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">5 He was wounded because of our rebellious deeds,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">crushed because of our sins;<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">he endured punishment that made us well;<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">because of his wounds we have been healed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I’m not sure why translators in the 16th century chose the words “griefs” and “sorrows” to capture the meaning of Isaiah 53:4. Perhaps the old English meanings of these words are different than what we understand now. Or maybe the translation tools they had available were not as extensive or sophisticated as translators today. Fortunately, the Holy Spirit saw fit to ensure that future generations of believers would not miss the meaning of Isaiah 53. Therefore, Matthew, being moved and directed by the Holy Spirit, interprets the meaning of Isaiah 53 for us. In doing so, he answers the question of why Jesus always healed everyone. Jesus healed because divine healing is part of his finished work of redemption. Divine healing is part of the atoning work of Christ.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Isaiah 53 is a prophecy pointing to the coming Messiah’s work. Christ would suffer and die on behalf of God’s people, bearing the punishment for sin. We know that this is the accurate interpretation of this passage because Peter explains the meaning in 1 Peter 2:21–25:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">1 Peter 2:21–25 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">21 For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. 22 He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. 23 When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. 24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. 25 For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In this passage in Peter, we see that on the cross, Jesus “bore our sins” for our benefit. In other words, the suffering that Jesus experienced in his physical body was the punishment we should have suffered. His substitution accomplished the forgiveness of sins and also rebirth. Notably, Peter states that we are healed by his wounds—not his death—that we are healed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Given the enormous gain imputed to the believer due to Christ’s substitution work, we might be tempted to think of this gain only in terms of sin and forgiveness. However, divine healing is not merely a reiteration of forgiveness of sin. This truth is why Matthew’s explanation of Isaiah 53 is so important. Matthew emphasizes that the substitutionary work of Christ includes physical healing.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><a id=\"conclusion\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Conclusion<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">In review, what we have learned so far. First, we have discovered that Jesus explained his ministry through the writings of the Old Testament. Until the epistles were written, the early church only had the Old Testament as Scripture. Therefore, the church relied on the Apostles’ teaching to understand Old Testament references to Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">Matthew records an episode where Jesus healed all the sick. Performing healing was quite typical of the ministry of Jesus. However, what is atypical of this passage is that Matthew explains healing as a fulfillment of prophecy. Matthew referenced Isaiah, which foretells that the Messiah’s work will become a substitute for us and took upon himself the penalty for our sins. Instead of God pouring out his wrath on us, he poured his wrath upon Jesus of Nazareth on the cross.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">We also learned that Scripture interprets Scripture. The passage in 1 Peter 2 explains the meaning of Isaiah 53. The emphasis of 1 Peter’s selection might be interpreted as forgiveness of sins only. Hence, the Holy Spirit saw fit to reiterate in Matthew 8 that Isaiah 53 also refers to physical healing and spiritual deliverance from demonic power.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">We must understand divine healing in its proper context in Scripture. It is part of the atoning work of Christ, part of redemption. Receiving healing for sickness is as much a part of the eternal Gospel as receiving forgiveness for sins.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_close\">In the name of God, Amen.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
