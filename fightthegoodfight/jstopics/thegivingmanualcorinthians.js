These chapters instruct congregations on how to raising money in the kingdom in the God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Corinthians 8:1<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">8 We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia, 2 for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Now the first thing we see is that raising money is about receiving the grace of God. This means two things:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">1.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">Fund raising is not a natural, secular activity. God wants to be involved.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">2.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">God wants to provide his wisdom, his understanding, and his power to cause us to be successful.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">A Severe Test of Affliction<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Also, we see is that the believers in Macedonia were going through a severe financial trial. Something had happened to them that caused them to become extremely poor. They were just hanging on by a thread. The poverty of the Macedonians<\/span><span class=\"f_quote\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">is an indicator that Christian fundraising is never about how much church people have to give to the cause. Being poor does not exclude you from causing you to be successful. Often when we fundraiser with a secular mindset, our thinking is, <\/span><span class=\"f_quote\">“How can we get as many people to give as much as they possibly can to meet our goals”<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> or<\/span><span class=\"f_quote\"> “How can we get rich people to give lots of money to our cause.”<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> However, the basic tenet of gospel fund raising is that the believer’s individual financial situation is of no consequence because it is not about what we have but about what God will do.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Poverty And Joy<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Corinthians 8:1<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">5 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">8 We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia, 2 for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part. 3 For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own accord,4 begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints — 5 and this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Note the joy of the Macedonians. Joy means gladness and calm delight. It speaks to attitude and enthusiasm. Notice the Macedonians were enthusiastic about helping other people. This wasn’t a fund raising effort that would benefit them but others, and yet the Macedonians were enthusiastic about taking part. Now why would that be? Verse 5 gives us the answer in the phrase,<\/span><span class=\"f_quote\"> “they gave themselves first to the Lord.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><a id=\"giveyourselftojesus\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Give Yourself To Jesus<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">What this meant is that the Macedonians purposed first to put on the mind of Christ, and to give the way Christ commanded give. To give cheerfully, purposefully, with a desire to help others and not to take credit for oneself. A key to giving with God’s grace active in our lives is for us to be cheerful in our giving and with a desire to help others.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">One reason I’m not a huge fan of secular fund raising in the church is because believers often execute their plans without the spirit of Christ. For example, suppose I organize an event and charge a high price for tickets. Automatically, I’ve excluded the poor or people who are going through a financial trial. The Scripture forbids us from dishonoring those who are poor amongst us by judging them or blaming them for their need (James 2). The Spirit of Christ would lead us to help them by paying for their ticket. Instead, some grumble when others are offered to attend the event for a discounted price or even for free because this reduces our income from ticket sales. At that point, the entire fundraiser just devolves into a work of the flesh that grieves the Holy Spirit. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><a id=\"giveaccordingtoyourmeans\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Give According to Your Means<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In verse 3, Paul commends the Macedonians for sacrificially giving according to what they had and even beyond that, to the best of their ability. The fund raising in Macedonia was for the suffering Jewish Christians in Judea. The Gentile Christians were putting aside whatever they could share on a regular basis, perhaps weekly or monthly, and just let the collection build-up. Then when emissaries from Jerusalem arrived to collect the offering they had a substantial offering to bring to the beleaguered saints in Judea. The Macedonians were motivated by brotherly love, compassion, generosity and self-discipline. They didn’t need gimmicks, far-fetched promises, constant nagging or pressure to get them to give and keep giving. As they gave, and exercised the discipline of consistent generosity, God gave them even more grace to generously and consistently give. The apostle Paul called this cycle <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">the grace of giving.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><a id=\"giveyourselftotheminister\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Give Yourself to the Minister<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">5 and this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">This is unexpected. Grace-based fund raising is done under the leadership of ministry. As I meditated on this verse, I recalled that in the Bible, every time there was an initiative to raise money for the work of God, ministers were deeply involved in the effort. In many cases of supernatural provision in the Bible, there was a prophet, or a minister involved as well.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Some in the church have been taught fund raising is not the purview of the pastor. Our instinct is to form a committee and do our thing while the pastor worries about sermons and evangelism. However, the New Testament gives us a different view. Church fund raising cannot be done apart from the ministry.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">One reason is that it is the responsibility of ministry to teach believers how to give and to encourage them to be faithful over an extended period of time. We see this in the ministry of Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah in the Old Testament. And we see this in the ministry of the Apostle Paul. Let’s see how this concept worked with the Macedonians. First, Agabus the prophet predicted a famine:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Acts 11:27<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">30 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">27 Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28 And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius). 29 So the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, &nbsp;to send relief to the brothers living in Judea. 30 And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Right off the bat we see that Christian giving is often based on a supernatural foundation of revelation delivered by a ministry gift. Second, we see that the Macedonians accepted the ministry of the prophet, and also the ministry of Paul. Their response to Paul was, we want to help our brothers who will be affected by this famine, but as you can see, we are suffering financially as well. What can we do?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We cannot overlook this point. The Macedonians understood that their spiritual father was the one to give them directions and guidance. They didn’t just form committees to fry chicken and bake cupcakes. They allowed the Holy Spirit to speak to through them through their spiritual elder. Paul gave the Macedonians the same instructions he gave to the Corinthians, indeed to all the churches he superintended. 2 Corinthians 8,9 is a summary of the teaching that Paul taught in every place about giving. Remember Paul was providing teaching to poor people. He emphasized that heart attitude is far more important than the amount that is collected. Paul taught that if a believer has the right heart, God would supernaturally multiply and increase their gift.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Second, Paul emphasized that gifts should not be given under pressure. I believe in the concept of tithing, but I object to the way many preach tithing in the New Testament church. They preach tithing with a note of fear or with a note of pride. They say,<\/span><span class=\"f_quote\"> “If you don’t tithe, God will bankrupt you.” <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">They put pressure on people to give in a manner that exceeds their faith. Alternatively, many believers become proud of their tithing. They want to sound a trumpet and let the world know they are tithers. They are always looking for ways to brag about tithing.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Apostles did not pressure the early Church to tithe. I was astonished to realize that there is not one apostolic command to tithe in the New Testament. In fact, the words <\/span><span class=\"f_quote\">tithe<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">, or <\/span><span class=\"f_quote\">tithing<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> are rarely used in the Epistles. There are references to tithing and there are commands to give, but in the New Testament cheerful, freewill giving supersedes strict percentage tithing. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The third principle is that in the kingdom of God money functions exactly the way seed functions when it is sown in the ground! There is a supernatural component to Christian giving that secular fund raising simply does not understand. Unfortunately, many believers don’t understand it either.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
