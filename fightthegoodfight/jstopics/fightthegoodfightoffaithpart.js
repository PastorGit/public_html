hmBody:"<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Introduction<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Preaching on faith should never get old, because as believers we live by faith, and the God we serve is pleased by our faith. Jesus taught on many topics, but he always came back to the subject of faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Galatians 3:11 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">11 Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 11:5<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">6 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">5 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. 6 And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">An important aspect of living by faith is understanding that to live by faith involves struggle. Paul described it as “fighting the good fight of faith.” Most Christians clearly understand that the Christian life involves struggle. However, many Christians don’t always understand the nature of the struggle as it relates to the fight of faith. Let me give you an example.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">The Local Fight<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The local church is in a fight of faith. We need to raise funds and to do it God’s way, and this takes faith and this exercise of faith will be a struggle. We are finding that as we, as a church family, press closer to the finish line, for this trial, dark power is resisting us every step of the way. We are being attacked in our bodies, in our families and especially in our finances. Although God promised to give us a full supply with plenty of money left over to give to the house of God, many of us are struggling financially out of proportion to what is normal.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We are in a supernatural financial storm. We are dealing with an exceedingly powerful principality that is blocking our finances. However, if Jesus were here in the flesh this morning, I believe his reaction to our challenge of faith would be no different to how he reacted to the disciples when they encountered the super demon who wouldn’t leave its victim. He would ask us, “where is your faith?”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">A Suffering Child<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Mark 9:14<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">29 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">14 And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. 15 And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, &nbsp;were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him. 16 And he asked them, &nbsp;“What are you arguing about with them?” 17 And someone from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute. 18 And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.” 19 And he answered them, &nbsp;“O faithless generation, &nbsp;how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me.” 20 And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. 21 And Jesus asked his father, &nbsp;“How long has this been happening to him?” And he said, “From childhood. 22 And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” 23 And Jesus said to him, &nbsp;“‘If you can’! &nbsp;All things are possible for one who believes.” 24 Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, “I believe; &nbsp;help my unbelief!” 25 And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, &nbsp;“You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.” 26 And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, “He is dead.” 27 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. 28 And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?” 29 And he said to them, &nbsp;“This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If we compare Mark’s account with the same account recorded in Matthew and Luke, we get a fuller picture of the situation. The man’s son had a demon who whose oppression manifested in the form of epileptic seizures around water or fire to kill the boy.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Certainly, the father would understand that being a believer involved struggle. Also, the father understood something that many Christians do not; that God wasn’t the one who gave the son epilepsy. The father understood that his son was being attacked by a malevolent spirit trying to kill him!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The man’s son had suffered a long time, and surely, the man had tried everything to get his son delivered, but nothing worked. However, he heard that the disciples were successful in casting out demons. Therefore, he took his son to the disciples to have them cast that demon out.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">What Is Faith?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Faith is based on the Word of God. It is hearing and doing the word of God, expecting that the promises of the Word of God are happening in our lives, even when we see something different.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Faith is designed to work in a struggle. In that sense, faith is a weapon. It’s true worth and value are revealed when it is tested in warfare. Faith success involves struggle because the devil doesn’t give up easily.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">My message to the local church is that we have zero chance of receiving financial deliverance if we neglect faith. Just like that man had zero chance of seeing his son delivered without taking him to Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
