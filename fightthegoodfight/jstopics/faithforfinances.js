hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When it comes to raising funds, which we are called to do, we have been looking about how to fight the good fight of faith as it pertains to this topic. We must ask ourselves, <\/span><span class=\"f_quote\">is raising money for God’s work covered in the Bible? Does God give us instructions about how to believe for money to finish his work and pay our bills?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Asking this question brought us to 2 Corinthians 8-9, as this is the longest passage in the New Testament that deals specifically on raising funds for God’s work. We have been looking at this passage carefully because we have learned that the way we develop our faith is by hearing the Word of God. Second, the way that we make our way prosperous is by meditating in the Word of God. So carefully looking at the Word of God is what we need to do.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Finances in 2 Corinthians 8,9<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We will continue to look at 2 Corinthians 8,9 to focus on important spiritual principles:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">1.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">God gave instructions to the Apostle Paul for how churches are to raise money for God’s work. These instructions come with a promise. If believers obeyed Paul’s instructions, God would bless his people so they could successfully raise all the money they needed for God’s work.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">2.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">Paul taught this plan, which he called the grace of giving, wherever he went. And his sons in the ministry taught this plan as well.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">3.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">God’s fund raising plan centered around giving. 2 Corinthians 8<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">9 is a detailed look at how Christians should give, with an emphasis on heart attitude rather than amount. There is no mention of strict percentage giving, such as Mosaic tithing, in 2 Corinthians 8<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">9; however, there is frequent mention of giving cheerfully, generously, and according to what a person has.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">4.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">God’s fund raising plan offers no strategies for raising funds other than giving.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">5.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">There is no mention of believers being instructed to engage in any kind of buying, selling of goods and services as a church entity.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">6.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">There is no mention of the church, as an entity, being instructed to ask the government for money.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">7.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">There is no mention of the church, as an entity, being instructed to ask their non-Christian neighbors for money.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">8.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">There is no mention of the church, as an entity, organizing raffles, bake sales, flea markets, concerts, dinners, and the like.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">9.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">Also, there is no mention of local churches instructing their members to have fund raising campaigns internally.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">10.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">We do see individual members of local churches making pledges based entirely on their conscience and their financial situation.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">11.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">Fourth, God’s fund raising plan commands believers not to give under pressure. All gifts must be given willingly and out of careful consideration of one’s financial situation.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">12.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">Fifth, God’s fund raising plan boldly details what God promises to do for individual believers who give properly. The list is quite long, but it is summarized in this way:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">13.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">If believers give properly, God will make them financially rich. Rich means that they will have an abundant supply to meet their own needs with plenty of money left over to give to all kinds of ministry projects.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">14.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">Finally, we see that God’s fund raising plan worked for the Philippian churches. You can trace the grace of giving plan through the New Testament as it worked out in the Philippian churches. The Philippian churches were especially diligent about obeying Paul’s instructions, and God brought them from severe poverty to divine wealth. It didn’t happen overnight, and there were difficulties, but in the end, God kept his promises.<\/span><\/p>"
