hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Jesus had given his disciples the authority to cast out demons in their ministry. They had had so much success that they came to Jesus after ministering in the field, dancing and rejoicing because the demons were subject to them in the name of Jesus. However, this demon resisted their attempts at exorcism. This wasn’t the ordinary kind of demon that the disciples could cast out. This was a <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">super demon.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> This super demon had extraordinary dark power:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">It could cause the boy to become as rigid as a statue or writhe on the ground like a snake.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">It could physically beat the boy so that terrible bruises and welts appeared on his body.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">It could make the boy scream horrible, piercing screams, convulse terribly, and foam at the mouth.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">It is possible that the manifestation of demonic power overwhelmed the disciples’ faith to exorcise it!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Imagine how discouraging that must have been for this man! The handpicked apostles of the Lord could not prevail against the devil. In a last-ditch attempt, the man brings the boy to Jesus, who by this time, was not an easy person even to reach because of the crowds. Jesus drove the demon out, but he was annoyed at his disciples. He rebuked them for not having enough faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">How Does This Relate to the Fight of Faith?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">This episode with the demon in Scripture underscores that the fight of faith is supernatural.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Prescription drugs could not have saved that boy.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Medical marijuana could not have helped that child.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Yoga, a diet of herbs and nuts, electroshock therapy, hypnosis, positive thinking, would all have been completely ineffective.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The boy had a spiritual problem, and the only way out of his problem was a man in the earth who would exercise and release faith by speaking words of deliverance. As believers, many of our problems may seem to have a natural source but have a demonic root cause. If we only think of our problems in natural terms, we may neglect the necessity to use faith to get at the core of the problem.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Make Correct Associations<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Further, we must correctly diagnose the source of our spiritual problems. Thanks to the Catholic Church, we have been indoctrinated with the idea that we must do penance for our sins. Therefore, our first thought in a time of trial is that God is paying us back for our sins that we somehow didn’t confess, and that now we are reaping judgment for unconfessed sins. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">We Reap What We Sow?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We reap what we sow, but the whole point of redemption in Christ is that we don’t reap the fruit of the sins we have sown! Put differently, Jesus came to save us from the bitter harvest of sin that awaited us. On the cross, Jesus of Nazareth was reaping the consequences of the sinful lives we had sown! Further, Father God has provided in Christ ongoing forgiveness and cleansing from all sins. Therefore, the norm is not for God to attack our health, children, financial prosperity, or peace. We have been redeemed from the curse of the Law!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If we see our struggles properly, that is, as an attack from the Satan, we will be mentally prepared to fight the good fight of faith! Are there exceptions? Yes, there are. However, if we walk closely with God and walk in the light, he will show us when we miss it so we can repent.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
