hmBody:"<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Introduction<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">God is a warrior. The Bible says in Revelation 12, that a war broke out in heaven:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Revelation 12:7<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">8 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">7 Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels fought back, 8 but he was defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Satan and his followers dared to attack God, and God took care of business. We are made in the likeness of God, and God intends for us to have a warrior spirit. Paul exhorted Timothy to “fight the good fight of faith.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">God has called us to live by faith, therefore, our Christian lives will involve fighting. We are called to constantly fight the good fight of faith, because we are called to live by faith. Without faith, it is impossible to please God; therefore, our only choice is to fight if we want to please God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">We Fight for What God Has Already Given Us<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Remember, that the faith fight is about fighting for what God has already given us. Although God has freely given us things, we are called to receive them by faith. They don’t just fall on us like ripe fruit falling from a tree.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Some people say, “Well if God wants me to have something, I will have it. It’s all up to the sovereign will of God.” That is only partly true. God’s will is sovereign. And God does will for us to have some things and not other things. But God has sovereignly determined that his people should live by faith and therefore receive by faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">The Promised Land<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The textbook example of this is Israel taking the Promised Land. God gave Israel the Promised Land, but Israel had to fight to inhabit the land. Similarly, in the world of the New Testament, believers are called to fight. However, we do not fight giants in the land of Canaan. We are fighting demons (Eph 6:12):<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">We are not fighting our neighbors.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">We are not called to fight each other.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">We are not called to fight atheists, homosexuals, and abortionists.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">We are called to fight the devil<\/span><\/p>\n\r<h1 class=\"p_Heading1\"><span class=\"f_Heading1\">The Connection Between Faith and Struggle<\/span><\/h1>\n\r<h1 class=\"p_Heading1\"><span class=\"f_body\">There is a connection between pleasing God, living by faith, receiving what God has for us and fighting the enemy. Anything that we are to receive in this life is supposed to come through struggle<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><\/h1>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Since we are soldiers and we are called to fight in this life, then we must fight well. God intends for us to fight to win and to fight to the finish. A big part of that is attitude.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Iron Mike Tyson<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Many people believed Mike Tyson would not become a great boxer because he was short. But his trainer, Cus D’amato, molded Iron Mike into a champion. One way he did that was to drill into Mike a certain kind of savagery that he brought into the ring. He instilled in Mike the heart of a champion who would never be satisfied with less than victory. Mike’s trainers emphasized mastery of the basics, and Mike was known for his relentless practices of boxing basics. He mastered boxing fundamentals by watching films and practicing good techniques for hours.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The discipline of athletes in the natural is similar to our commitment to fight the good fight of faith. Just as an athlete must have the attitude of a winner, so must we. And just as a great athlete must invest time in mastering the fundamentals of his sport, so we must master the fundamentals of living by faith. Let’s review some of these fundamentals.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
