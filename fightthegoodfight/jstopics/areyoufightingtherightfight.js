For example, the Bible teaches that as Christians, we have obligations to the government. We must pay our taxes and obey the laws of the land. If we we are not paying our taxes, then we are not living by faith (that, is obedience to the Word of God) and God won’t be pleased. We can’t say, I’m believing God for a new house, while we deliberately neglect to pay our taxes!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">The Lust Of The Eyes<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">A big part of the faith battle is receiving things.

We feel that working in the church, giving to the church, and being poor are part of a package that God wants for us, but when we get to heaven, we will get a big reward. Like most deceptions, there is partial truth in this. God will reward us for the charitable deeds we have done in this body on earth. As we have often discussed, the life on earth is full of hardship and struggle. However, God has not called the church to be broke. There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Jesus was poor, but he wasn’t broke. Jesus was poor compared to Caesar or Pharaoh, and he became poor (compared to what he had in heaven) because he wanted to make us rich. But even in his earthly poverty, Jesus wasn’t broke.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When he was born, a caravan of wealthy men traveled for a year to give him valuable treasures that included gold. God made sure the first family would always have all that they needed. When Herod tried to kill the baby Jesus, Joseph and Mary could leave immediately and flee to Egypt. They didn’t have to sell the house or have a garage sale to raise funds for their trips. They could leave it all behind without delay because Mary and Joseph had sufficient wealth and riches in their house to go to another country and live for years.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We also know that Jesus wasn’t broke in ministry because his ministry had full-time staff and a treasurer. Remember, Peter, James, John, and the rest weren’t a bunch of homeless people living on the street when Jesus found them. They were men who had businesses, careers, families, and property. They didn’t go bankrupt when they went into the ministry with Jesus. By their own testimony, they lacked nothing (Luke 22:35).<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I’m not arguing that Jesus or his disciples were rich in the sense of living lavish lifestyles. My point is that they weren’t broke. They weren’t standing on street corners begging for change to preach the Gospel. They weren’t organizing bake sales and concerts to raise money. They had a full supply because God provided for them.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">God wants to do the same thing for us. It’s our covenant right to have our needs met. We are entitled to the blessing of Abraham. However, we are not entitled to get any and everything our flesh—that is, our sinful nature, that lurks in our members—desires. We have to learn the difference between prosperity and greed; between desiring wonderful things and coveting things for the sake of having things.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Meditation In The Word<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The third thing is that we have to ask ourselves what does the Word say? In the remainder of this message<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> we will investigate how to give.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
