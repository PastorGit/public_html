hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We have been learning about fighting the good fight of faith. We have learned that God is a warrior, and because we share his likeness, we are warriors too! We are called to fight. But our fight is not with other human beings. We are fighting a fight of faith in which we wrestle against the forces of darkness to lay hold of eternal life, that is, all the promises that God has promised us in Christ Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Although God has given us everything that pertains to life and godliness, we still have to receive what God has provided by exercising faith. God’s blessings will not fall on us like ripe fruit falling from a tree.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Our textbook illustration of this principle is seen in Israel’s possession of the Promised Land. Although God gave Israel the Promised Land, Israel still had to fight to receive every inch of land. They were engaged in a serious battle of faith against fearsome opponents (Numbers 13,14).<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">You and I must remember that life works differently for the believer than the unbeliever. We should not compare our lives to those who are not believers (Psalm 73:1-14). In this Psalm, the psalmist initially complains that the wicked seem to live easy lives and riches just come to them. They don’t seem to suffer like the righteous do even though they have no respect for God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If we were to look around, we might wonder why we, as believers, struggle to make even the simplest of moves, and why sinners have plenty of resources. This is especially true in the area of money. The reason is that we are fighting a fight that unbelievers are not fighting. We are fighting the fight of faith. And this fight has benefits for us not only in this life, but in the life to come:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Corinthians 4:15<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">18 New King James Version (NKJV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">15 For all things are for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">16 Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. 17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, &nbsp;18 while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We must remember that the righteous sufferings of this life are not in vain. God will redeem our righteous tears as preparation for an unending life in eternity. <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">Don’t give up!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">To live by faith is to fight the good fight of faith. God has called us to fight this fight because God has destined us to win!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">However, in order to win, we must fight well. We fight well by:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Seeking first God’s kingdom.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Make sure we are in the right fight.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Meditating on the Word of God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_close\">In the name of God, &nbsp;Amen<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
