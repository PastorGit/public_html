hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">First, we must be convinced that the fight of faith that I am pursuing is the fight of faith that God wants me to fight. If I am sick, I can be confident that God wants me well, so I may be confident to fight for my healing. However, with respect to financial prosperity, the fight for faith is usually more nuanced. Therefore, patient discernment of the Father\'s will is needed. However, we do know this principle is always true:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Matthew 6:33 King James Version (KJV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Let\'s consider this example. You may want to move to Florida, and you are believing God to get you there. However, your elderly mother in New York needs your help in managing her affairs. Is believing God to move to Florida the right thing to do? It could be, but you would have to consider this Scripture in making your decision:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">1 Timothy 5:4 New Living Translation (NLT)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">4 But if she has children or grandchildren, their first responsibility is to show godliness at home and repay their parents by taking care of them. This is something that pleases God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">You can see here, that you may want to do something that pleases you, but the Word is reminding you that you have a sacrificial obligation to care for your elderly mother. In this fictitious example, fighting the good fight of faith to get to Florida may be the wrong fight for you. In other words, <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">we have to be careful to adjust our faith and desires to line up with what the Bible is commanding, instead of doing what we want.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Let\'s consider another example. You are believing for the Lord to prosper your business in America, but you have overstayed your visa. Immigration laws require you to return to your home country and as a result, you may miss out on some exciting business deals. What should you do?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Romans 13:1-2 New Living Translation (NLT)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">13 Everyone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God. 2 So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and they will be punished.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">It’s not wrong to believe God to prosper, and it will take a spiritual fight to receive what is yours. However, if you are breaking the laws of the land, believing God for exciting business deals with an expired Visa is the wrong fight to wage. This is because you disobeying Scripture. You must get your life and behavior in line with Scripture so you will be on solid ground to fight the good fight of faith. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Fighting the good fight of faith requires that we continually search our hearst and make sure that we are not becoming lustful, covetous, bitter or in any other way giving place to the flesh nature. Indeed, the Apostle John admonishes the church in the following verse:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">1 John 2:15-17 New Living Translation (NLT)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">15 Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the world, you do not have the love of the Father in you. 16 For the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in our achievements and possessions. These are not from the Father, but are from this world. 17 And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In the West, the lust of our eyes manifests as materialism. God likes wonderful things. But God doesn’t have sinful flesh as we do. So even though it is natural for us to like wonderful things because we are created in God’s image, we must fight to make sure we are not sliding into materialism. One way we can escape materialism is to ask ourselves, <\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">am I willing to take less? Can I put my cravings aside to get a material thing that is not as shiny or new?<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
