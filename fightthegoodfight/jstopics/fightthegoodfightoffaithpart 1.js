Do you see a warrior? Many of us don’t see a warrior looking a back at us. But the truth is we are all God’s warriors. Now we read in our Scripture text that God wanted the generations of Israel to learn how to fight enemies in the Promised Land. God could have wiped out the nations without his people being involved at all. However, he deliberately wanted his people to fight. This concept is carried forward in the New Testament. God has called us to fight a good fight of faith. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 10:38 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">38 but my righteous one shall live by faith,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">  &nbsp; and if he shrinks back,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">my soul has no pleasure in him.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">There is a relationship between fighting the good fight of faith and living by faith. To do one is to do the other; living by faith means fighting the good fight of faith. Our life on this earth is intended to be a fight, and Hebrews lets us know that <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">living out this fight of faith pleases God. <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">Therefore, our proper response to challenging times and suffering is not to roll over and get discouraged, but to have a fighter’s mentality. In addition to pleasing God, we fight the good fight of faith because it is the only way we can receive our inheritance — that is, the blessings that God would have for us in this life.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Galatians 3:10<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">18 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">10 For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, &nbsp;“Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.” 11 Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith.” 12 But the law is not of faith, rather “The one who does them shall live by them.” 13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us — for it is written, &nbsp;“Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree” — 14 so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">15 To give a human example, brothers:even with a manmade covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. 16 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, &nbsp;“And to your offspring,” who is Christ. 17 This is what I mean:the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void.18 For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">This passage teaches us that as believers we have received by faith the “blessing of Abraham” (v. 14) also referred to as “the promises made to Abraham” (v. 16), “the promise” (v. 17), and “a covenant previously ratified by God” (v. 17). Therefore, we are heirs of the <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">promises of a divine covenant, <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">ratified by the shed blood of Christ. Another way to describe this inheritance is “eternal life” or “abundant life.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">This inheritance, although freely given to us by God, doesn’t just materialize by God waving a magic wand. We lay hold of eternal life, which is our inheritance in Christ, by fighting the good fight of faith. For example, the children of Israel had to fight giants to receive their inheritance. God gave them the land, but there were giants in the land. They had to fight in the name of the Lord to drive them out.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Another example is healing belonged to every Israelite that Jesus healed. But the people had to receive healing by faith. They couldn’t just click their heels three times and be healed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We must get this spiritual concept down deep in our spirit:<\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\"> in this life, I must fight for the things God has freely given to me. But the fight is a good fight, because it is a fight that God means for me to win. <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">So how do we win? Below are some points I want to give you on how to win the fight of faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
