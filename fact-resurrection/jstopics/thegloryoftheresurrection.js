This is a competition where two extraordinary athletes face off in an enclosed arena and try to knock each other senseless.

He <\/span><span class=\"f_illus_text\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">raises<\/span><span class=\"f_illus_text\"> the arm of the winner. By Father God raising Jesus from the dead, he is declaring Jesus the victor over death, hell and the grave!<\/span><\/p>"
