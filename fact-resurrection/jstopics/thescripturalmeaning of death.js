hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">To better understand the resurrection, we need to understand death has different meanings in Scripture. There is physical death, spiritual death and the Second Death. Despite having different nuances in meanings in Scripture, death always includes the concept of separation.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.5000rem 0 0.5000rem 3.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">Physical Death<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">Physical death refers to the common understanding of death, and represents when the body stops functioning; the body has no pulse or brain activity and no beating heart. This “physical death” exclusively applies to the body, not the soul or spirit. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">Christians believe the human spirit and soul is the essential, invisible part of a human being. Although Scripture often uses spirit and soul interchangeabley, Hebrews 4:12 teaches the spirit and soul are distinct. Put simply, the human spirit is the invisible part of man that interacts with God and the human soul is the invisible part of man the engages with the world in the form of the will and emotions. The human spirit is recreated in the New Birth (<\/span><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">2 Corinthians 5:17 ESV<\/a><\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">), however, the Bible exhorts Christians to “save their souls” or renew their minds with the Word of God &nbsp;(<\/span><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=James%201:21&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">James 1:21 ESV<\/a><\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">, <\/span><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Romans%2012:2&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">Romans 12:2 ESV<\/a><\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">). For the purpose of our discussion, when I refer to the human spirit, I am referring to the spirit and soul collectively since they indeed operate in syncronization. God created man’s physical body from the dust of the earth, but when he breathed into man the breathe of life, man became a living being, that is the physical body was animated by a spirit and soul (<\/span><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Genesis%202:7&amp;version=NET\" class=\"weblink\">Genesis 2:7 NET<\/a><\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">).<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">Once God creates a human spirit (that is the human spirit and human soul together) it can never be destroyed. Our human spirit is the real you and I that lives on earth in a human earth suit which we call our body. Let’s bear this out with the word:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockTexthead\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #4f81bd; text-decoration: none;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=John%202:19-21&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">John 2:19–21 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockText\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_BlockText\">19 Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” 20 The Jews then said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?” 21 But he was speaking about the temple of his body.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockTexthead\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #4f81bd; text-decoration: none;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:1-3&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">2 Corinthians 5:1–3 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockText\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_BlockText\">5 For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 2 For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, 3 if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockTexthead\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #4f81bd; text-decoration: none;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=James%202:26&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">James 2:26 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockText\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_BlockText\">26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">We see from these verses that Jesus, John, James and Paul all agree that the spirit of a man is different from the body of a man. When the physical body is destroyed, the spirit is not destroyed, and the physical body cannot live without a human spirit inhabiting it. Therefore, physical death involves the <\/span><span class=\"f_Body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">separation<\/span><span class=\"f_Body\"> of the the human spirit from the human body. When the spirit leaves the body, the body dies. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_illus_text\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin: 0.1875rem 5.1250rem 0.2500rem 6.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_illus_text\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_illus_text\">When the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the summer of 1945, the poor souls that were directly in the path of the bomb blast were completely vaporized. Their bodies were disassembled at the atomic level in an instant. As an eerie aside, the thermal radiation that vaporized these victims left permanent shadows of them on the buildings and streets. In Japan, there are shadow images of children playing and people walking, but their bodies are no more.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.5000rem 0 0.5000rem 3.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">Spiritual Death<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">Spiritual death is a different manifestation of death. Since human spirit cannot be destroyed, spiritual death is not the annihilation of the spirit (and soul), but rather it is when the human spirit is separated from God. Genesis gives an example of this. In <\/span><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Genesis%202:15-17&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">Genesis 2:15–17<\/a><\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">, God commanded Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and warned him that if he did, he would die that very day. However, notice what happens when Adam and Eve disobeyed God’s commandment:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockTexthead\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #4f81bd; text-decoration: none;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Genesis%203:1-7&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">Genesis 3:1–7 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockText\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_BlockText\">3 Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockText\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_BlockText\">He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” 2 And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, 3 but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’” 4 But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. 5 For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” 6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. 7 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">When Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden fruit they didn’t die that day <\/span><span class=\"f_SubtleEmphasis\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\">physically<\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">. In fact, Adam and Eve would continue to live in their fallen state for many more centuries. <\/span><span class=\"f_Body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">But they did die spiritually. <\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">This means that their transgression separated them from God. Adam and Eve would eventually die physically, but only because spiritual death lead to the decay and withering of their physical body.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockTexthead\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #4f81bd; text-decoration: none;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Romans%205:12&amp;version=NLT\" class=\"weblink\">Romans 5:12 New Living Translation (NLT)<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockText\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_BlockText\">12 When Adam sinned, sin entered the world. Adam’s sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Notice that spiritual death caused physical death.<\/span><span class=\"f_Body\"> God created man to live forever. But sin changed that. Sin killed man spiritually, and man’s spiritual death eventually lead to physical death for the entire human race. <\/span><span class=\"f_Body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Spiritual death, like physical death, also involves separation.<\/span><span class=\"f_Body\"> Whereas physical death is the separation of the spirit from the body, spiritual death is the separation of the human spirit from God the Creator due to sin. Sin separates us from God, and sin leads to our physical death.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.5000rem 0 0.5000rem 3.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">The Second Death<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">The final kind of death presented in Scripture is the Second Death. The Second Death is unique from the other types of death because it is irrevocable. It is the <\/span><span class=\"f_SubtleEmphasis\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\">permanent<\/span><span class=\"f_Body\"> separation of the human spirit from the mercy of God, and when the human spirit is cast into the lake of fire and spends eternity in torment.

And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. 13 And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. 14 Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
