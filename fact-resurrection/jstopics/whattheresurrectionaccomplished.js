hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">By raising Jesus from the dead, Father God proved:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.5000rem 0 0.5000rem 3.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">That Jesus is God<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">Jesus said he was God and linked his divinity and deity to the fact that God would raise him from the dead. Therefore, the resurrection assures us that our faith should be in Jesus alone. There are no other gods before Jesus!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.5000rem 0 0.5000rem 3.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">That Jesus was a worthy sacrifice<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">By raising Jesus from the dead, Father God declared that he accepted Jesus’ death on the cross as atonement for our sins. Therefore, the resurrection of Jesus, not our own efforts, accomplished full payment for our sins, and guarantees that God has forgiven all our sins—even secret sins—past, present and future.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.5000rem 0 0.5000rem 3.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">That Jesus is the seed of Abraham who blesses us with righteousness<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">By raising Jesus from the dead, Father God confirmed that Jesus is the promised Seed, or Messiah, and through Jesus the believer is made righteous. Therefore, we are 100% righteous before God and the promises of God belong to me because of Jesus’ finished work. Healing, restoration, deliverance, prosperity, peace, joy, wisdom—whatever good thing you need, is only a faith-filled prayer away.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.5000rem 0 0.5000rem 3.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">That Jesus has gone to prepare a place for us<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">By raising Jesus from the dead, Father God declared Jesus’ promise to be true:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockTexthead\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #4f81bd; text-decoration: none;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=John%2014:2-3&amp;version=KJV\" class=\"weblink\">John 14:2–3 King James Version (KJV)<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockText\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_BlockText\">2 In my Father\'s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.
