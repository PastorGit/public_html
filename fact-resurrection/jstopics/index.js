On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. 11 Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockText\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_BlockText\">12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. 15 We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. 16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. 17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. 18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. 19 If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">What is the meaning of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and why is it so important? The resurrection is the event where God the Father raises Jesus of Nazareth bodily from death. Paul teaches that the Christian faith rests on the fact of the resurrection. If Jesus was not raised from the dead, the Christian faith is a lie.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
