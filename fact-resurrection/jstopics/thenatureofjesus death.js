hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">Having looked at the meaning of death in its biblical context, we see how remarkable Jesus was in his mastery of death. In <\/span><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=John%2010:30&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">John 10:30<\/a><\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">, Jesus said, “The Father and I are one.” In this same passage, Jesus’ adversaries sought to stone him because in saying that he was one with the Father, Jesus was declaring himself to be God. The Scripture says: “Then they were trying again to seize Him, yet He eluded their grasp.” (<\/span><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=John%2010:39&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">John 10:39<\/a><\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">). Jesus of Nazareth was pure life. In this world, no manner of death could attach itself to him, because he was sinless and divine. He was God in the flesh.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_illus_text\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin: 0.1875rem 5.1250rem 0.2500rem 6.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_illus_text\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_illus_text\">Have you ever played with magnets? Do you remember how if you take two magnets and turn them just so, that instead of being attracted to each other, they repeal each other? As you bring the like poles of two magnets near each other, you can feel the force of repulsion. <\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_illus_text\">That repulsive force illustrates Jesus’ relationship with death. When his enemies tried to get near him to kill him, they couldn’t do it. When sickness came within the proximity of Jesus, it fled. When demons came near the Christ, they were expelled.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">Since it was impossible for death to fasten itself to Jesus, the only way for Jesus to die was if he willingly laid down his life:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockTexthead\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #4f81bd; text-decoration: none;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=John%2010:17-18&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">John 10:17–18 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockText\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_BlockText\">17 For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. 18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">Jesus laid down his life at Calvary. To what end? What was the significance of his death?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.5000rem 0 0.5000rem 3.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">Jesus Physically Died and was Buried<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">Certainly, Jesus died physically on the cross. Jesus was whipped and beaten beyond recognition before the Romans nailed him to the cross. After hanging on the cross for several hours, Jesus physically died; that is, his spirit left his body and his body expired. Joseph of Arimathea ensured that Jesus’s body was buried in his tomb (<\/span><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Mark%2015:43-46&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">Mark 15:43–36 ESV<\/a><\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">).<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading4\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.5000rem 0 0.5000rem 3.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_heading4\">The Significance of Burial<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">We bury a person only after they have been declared dead. We read accounts all the time of people whom doctors thought had died on the operating table, yet unexpectedly come back to life.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\">Most of the time, societies do not bury people immediately. Before a person is buried, someone pronounces that person dead, and then perhaps there is an autopsy. Often a caretaker prepares the body for burial. There is a funeral service that includes a viewing. With time passing, the corpse has every chance to show signs of life before going into the ground. After dying on the cross, the Roman authorities verified that Jesus’ body was stone cold dead (<\/span><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Mark%2015:43-46&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">Mark 15:43-46<\/a><\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">). Joseph of Armathaea and Nicodemus took the body of Jesus, prepared his body for burial and placed it in a tomb, covered by a massive rock. The burial of Jesus, then, signifies the absolute finality of Jesus’ physical death.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading3\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.5000rem 0 0.5000rem 3.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_heading3\">On the Cross, Jesus Tasted Spiritual Death<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Body\"><span class=\"f_Body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Jesus also tasted death spiritually.<\/span><span class=\"f_Body\"> The Bible says that:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockTexthead\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_Hyperlink\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #4f81bd; text-decoration: none;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/classic.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=1%20Peter%202:24&amp;version=ESV\" class=\"weblink\">1 Peter 2:24 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_BlockText\" style=\"border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom: none; margin: 0 4.0000rem 0 5.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_BlockText\">24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.

Additionally, by becoming sin for us, Jesus <\/span><span class=\"f_Body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">tasted<\/span><span class=\"f_Body\"> spiritual separation from His Father. I use the word “tasted” to describe Jesus’s encounter with separation to clearly distinguish from saying that Jesus <\/span><span class=\"f_Emphasis\" style=\"font-family: \'Open Sans\';\">did not die<\/span><span class=\"f_Body\"> spiritually in the same way that Adam died spiritually when Adam sinned (because unlike Adam, Jesus never sinned). Perhaps this statement better grasps at the mystery of the cross: <\/span><span class=\"f_Body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">on the cross,<\/span><span class=\"f_Body\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_Body\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Jesus tasted spiritual separation from His Father—that is, became spiritually cursed for our sake—sufficient to accomplish our redemption, and to make us righteous before God. <\/span><span class=\"f_Body\">Given this careful explanation, we say that Jesus tasted death spiritually and died physically, on our behalf.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
