Discernment is the ability to see beyond the obvious. God expects us to use discernment as a way of keeping Satan out of our business.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When you start seeing problems arise in your marriage, your relationship with your children, in your household, often, that is spiritual discernment working in your life. God is alerting you to issue so that you can deal with it first in prayer. By praying about it first, then you will understand what to do in the natural.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\">Unfortunately, like the disciples, when we sense problems, instead of praying like Jesus tells us to do, we fall asleep for sorrow.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> We get stressed out and we eat or watch TV or text or do something carnal. I’m guilty of this so I’m not picking on you.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The ministry of the Holy Spirit is to show you things to come and to teach you all things. The ministry of the Holy Spirit is not to show you sins in your neighbor’s life. But he will show you trouble on the horizon for those in your sphere of influence.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">John 14:26 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">26 But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">John 16:13–14 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. 14 He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Illustration<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When I was in Bible school, I became good friends with fellow students who were raising two daughters. I kept in touch with them, and the mother told me that that her eldest daughter had given birth to a son, but she wasn’t married. She told me that God had given her a vision of when her daughter got pregnant before her daughter even told her. She saw her daughter’s boyfriend, she saw the room they went to, she saw everything<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">. <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">God was preparing her and her husband for what was coming.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Brother Hagin tells a story that before one of the major economic downtowns in the US, the Holy Spirit warned him. God literally woke him up from sleep and told him to write down changes he should make in his ministry. God warned him of a coming recession and where he should make spending cuts in his ministry.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Of course, I am not saying that God will always speak to us in visions or in dramatic ways. What I am saying is that God has commanded us to be sober and alert and has given us the great and mighty Comforter to help us understand what is coming.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
