That is not how it works.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\"><span class=\"f_bullet\">Let’s take money for example. Many of us want God to pay our bills. That is not how he works. God wants to give you a plan to help you understand how create wealth so that you can pay your own bills. He wants to give you understanding how to apply wisdom and discipline to your finances, so you don’t keep making the same money mistakes repeatedly.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\"><span class=\"f_bullet\">Many of you want God to save your husband so you can have a marriage like the preachers you see on TV. That is not how he works. He wants to change you so you can be the best wife you can be and therefore be a loving and supportive witness to your husband. He wants to deliver you from a fantasy, and have you lived your life in a way that pleases him.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
