Christ, in paying the price for our redemption and reconciling us to the Father, also becomes our great High Priest through whom we receive help from God’s throne during our time of need.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 2:14–18 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">14 Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, 15 and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.16 For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. 17 Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. 18 For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Do you see the connection between Christ’s suffering and being able to help us?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">As we enter this time on the Christian calendar when we celebrate Christ’s passion, crucifixion, and resurrection, I want to connect the concepts of Christ’s suffering, Christ’s finished work, and the help he gives us as High Priest.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\">The key connector is the Garden of Gethsemane.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">The word Gethsemane means “oil press” in Hebrew and it is an olive garden where Jesus prayed before the night of his crucifixion. Now looks let’s look at the event:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Matthew 26:36–46 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go over there and pray”. 37 And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. 38 Then he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me”. 39 And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will”. 40 And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, “So, could you not watch with me one hour? 41 Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak”.42 Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done”. 43 And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. 44 So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. 45 Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46 Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand”.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Mark 14:32–42 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">32 And they went to a place called Gethsemane. And he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray”. 33 And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. 34 And he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch”. 35 And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. 36 And he said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will”. 37 And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? 38 Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak”. 39 And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. 40 And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him. 41 And he came the third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 42 Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand”.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Luke 22:39–46 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">39 And he came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him. 40 And when he came to the place, he said to them, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation”. 41 And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and prayed, 42 saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done”. 43 And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. 44 And being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground. 45 And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow, 46 and he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation”.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Gethsemane is an unusual event in the Gospel. We see Jesus in a light we have never seen him before<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">. <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">We see him at a point of absolute grief and weakness,<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: italic; color: #ed1c24;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">imploring his disciples for prayer, and asking God to have this cup pass from him.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We should not allow the flowery language of some Bible translations romanticize this episode. Hebrews elaborates on Gethsemane episode in very stark language:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 5:7 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">7 In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 5:7 New Living Translation (NLT)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">7 While Jesus was here on earth, he offered prayers and pleadings, with a loud cry and tears, to the one who could rescue him from death. And God heard his prayers because of his deep reverence for God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Bible teachers believe this passage refers to Jesus praying in the Garden and I agree with that. When Jesus was praying in the Garden,<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">he was not praying softly trying not to disturb his sleeping disciples or trying to keep from waking the neighbors<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: italic; color: #ed1c24;\">.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">He was pleading before God crying out with loud cries and tears.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In some cultures, people are conditioned to restrain themselves from showing emotion. But the Israelites were a very emotional and demonstrative people. They believed in loud expressions of worship and grief.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.3125rem 1.5000rem;\"><span class=\"f_body\">They didn’t just mourn; they<\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\"> wept and tore their clothes<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">. <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">They didn’t just pray, they<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">cried out<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: italic; color: #ed1c24;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">to God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.3125rem 1.5000rem;\"><span class=\"f_body\">They didn’t just give thanks, they<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">rejoiced<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">before God with singing, dancing, and laughter.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We see a picture of Jesus on his face, on the ground, in the dirt, crying, tears streaming down his face, pleading with God, asking God to find another way than for him to go to the cross.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Why? To quote Bible teacher John MacArthur, from his book, One Perfect Life, “His anguish had nothing to do with fear of men or the physical torments of the cross. He was sorrowful because within hours the full cup of divine fury against sin would be His to drink. It is possible for a person to die from sheer anguish”.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In other words, the sinless Jesus Christ knew that on the cross he would take in his body the sin of mankind as his own, and then experience God’s unrelenting wrath and judgment for that sin as if he committed those sins. The very horror of that thought nearly killed him. His body responded by releasing blood into his perspiration<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">, <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">which I am told is a rare and dangerous symptom of severe distress.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Let us not gloss over the fact that Jesus’s stress in the Garden was so severe that God the Father sent an angel to strengthen him while he was praying. And even after being strengthened by the angel, Jesus still had to pray more to get victory.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\">There are many lessons to be learned from Jesus’s crisis in the Garden<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-style: italic; color: #ed1c24;\">.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">I want to first focus on the fact that there is dimension of this Garden episode in which the credit and the glory belongs exclusively to Jesus Christ.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 5:5–10 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">5 So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">“You are my Son, <\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\"> today I have begotten you”;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">6 as he says also in another place,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">“You are a priest forever, <\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\"> after the order of Melchizedek”.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">7 In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. 8 Although he was a son he learned obedience through what he suffered. 9 And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, 10 being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">As Dr. Ray Stedman noted in his wonderful commentary on Hebrews, this passage in Hebrews is telling us that Jesus’s victory over the incomprehensible suffering he experienced in the garden qualified him to be at once, “our offering for sin and the High Priest who offered it”.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Put differently, by submitting to God’s will in the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus willingly went to the cross and offered himself up as the spotless, perfect offering for sin. Enduring the trial of Gethsemane, qualified him to become our great High Priest, because in the garden, Jesus understood the full consequences of taking our sins as his own. Now he can be merciful high priest because he understands the temptations to sin that we experienced, because he carried in his body the sins we committed although never committed the sins themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_emphasis\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\">Jesus can help us perfectly because he has gone through exactly what we are going through, though he himself never sinned.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_body\">Here is my simple point. Jesus understands you and I in a way that perhaps we have not considered lately. Jesus has experienced the gamut of human temptation, failure, and anguish in the Garden, and it nearly killed him. He knows your pain. He knows your problems. However, Jesus is Almighty God, risen from the dead and exalted. He has been given a Name above every name. And in His name, we can come before the omnipotent Father and ask for the things we need. Jesus can fix our problems.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">This is what we are to remember this holy week!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">You say, “Well, Pastor, I am hurting. I prayed and God didn’t answer my prayer”.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
