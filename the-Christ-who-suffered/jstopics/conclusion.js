However, we need to connect what happened historically to Christ’s present-day ministry of help.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Christ suffered terribly for us. He endured the full weight of God’s fury against sin so that we could know redemption. Beyond that, he suffered so that he could truly identify with us in our humanity, so that he could truly understand our grief, our sorrow, and our weakness in dealing with sin.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">That Jesus suffered in the Garden of Gethsemane qualifies him to be our High Priest. That means that God will never cast us away because of our sins. That also means that Jesus has the perfect plan to show us and lead us out of our sin problem.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">HOWEVER, we must listen to Jesus and follow his plan. We must pray fervently, with focus and purpose. We must pray with reverence. We must watchful and alert and pay attention to the warning signs that the Holy Spirit is revealing to us. When we see problems looming on the horizon, our first act should be to pray for strength, not to watch TV, to go to bed, or to get something to eat! Watch and pray! This is the Lord’s message to us.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_close\"><span class=\"f_close\">In the name of God, Amen<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_close\"><span class=\"f_close\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
