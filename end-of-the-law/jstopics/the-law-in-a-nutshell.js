Three things are noteworthy about these commandments<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> First, the Law of God expanded on universal concepts of right and wrong. Before Moses, people understood right from wrong and had a moral code like the ten commandments. For example, let us look<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">at Job:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Job 24:1–4<\/span><span style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-weight: bold; color: #833c0b;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">24 “Why are not times of judgment kept by the Almighty,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">  &nbsp; and why do those who know him never see his days?<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">2 Some move landmarks;<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">  &nbsp; they seize flocks and pasture them.<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">3 They drive away the donkey of the fatherless;<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">  &nbsp; they take the widow\'s ox for a pledge.<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">4 They thrust the poor off the road;<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">  &nbsp; the poor of the earth all hide themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Job lived before Moses and the Law. Yet Job had a keen sense of right and wrong and lived a life that pleased God. If Job did not have the Law of Moses to follow, how could he live pleasing to God? Because the Lord has written morality onto the conscience of every person who has ever lived. Job was righteous because he followed the moral guide of his conscience. Second, the Law of Moses defined ceremonies for the Hebrews to observe and specified specific laws and codes for them to follow in every aspect of their lives. These instructions included details on how to worship, work, set up governments, go to war, conduct oneself in the family, in society and many other daily activities. Third, the Law was given as a unit that could not be divided. From the beginning, Israel was not privileged to keep one part of the Law and not the other. The Apostle James explained that the law must be kept in its entirety<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> and if a person broke <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">one part<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> of the law, they broke the <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">entire part:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">James 2:10 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\">of it.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">There are two additional aspects of the Law. &nbsp;First, the God added the Law to his covenant with Abraham, as the Apostle Paul explains in Galatians 3:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Galatians 3:19 New Living Translation (NLT)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">19 Why, then, was the law given? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised. God gave his law through angels to Moses, who was the mediator between God and the people.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Galatians 3:23–26<\/span><span style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-weight: bold; color: #833c0b;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">New Living Translation (NLT)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">23 Before the way of faith in Christ was available to us, we were placed under guard by the law. We were kept in protective custody, so to speak, until the way of faith was revealed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">24 Let me put it another way. The law was our guardian until Christ came; it protected us until we could be made right with God through faith. 25 And now that the way of faith has come, we no longer need the law as our guardian.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">26 For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Therefore, the Law was given for a particular purpose and was meant to expire. It was valid only until Christ came. Paul is telling us that the Law of Moses was intended to be temporary and meant to be fulfilled.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Second, When God gave the Law to Israel through Moses, he knew that Israel could not and would not &nbsp;keep the Law. The point of the Law was to show Israel that she would never attain righteousness by keeping the Law. Even if a Hebrew keep a commandment here or there, they could never keep the entirety of the Law, so they would always stand condemned. The sacrificial system of the Law not only covered the people’s sins but pointed them to a coming Savior who would permanently save them from their sins.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">To review:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\"><span class=\"f_bullet\">The Law was a body of commandments that explained how men could be righteous in the presence of a holy God. The Law included universal, commonsense morality, like prohibitions against stealing, but the Law of Moses was much more than that.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">The Law was an indivisible unit that had to be fully obeyed. To break one iota of the Law was to break the entirety of the Law.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">The Law was added to God’s covenant with Abraham. It was added as a temporary addendum that was meant to be fulfilled and to expire.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">When God gave the Law, he understood that men would never be able to keep the Law. God gave the Law in part to demonstrate that man could never achieve righteousness by keeping the Law.<\/span><\/p>"
