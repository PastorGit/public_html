hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Notice I said without the Law. Of course, believers are called to live righteous life! Remember I discussed universal law earlier? Just because Christians do not follow the Law of Moses does not mean they have no law or code of conduct toÂ follow. The Law of Moses is the inspired Word of God. We would not understand who Jesus is without the Law, the Psalms, and the Prophets. The Law is the basis of morality for and law for much of Western civilization. Additionally, the morality of the New Testament is echoed in the Old Testament. What I am talking about is how we are made right by God. The believer is made right with God not by keeping the Law of Moses but by faith in Christ. Additionally, we grow in sanctification not by keeping the entirety of the Law as it was delivered to Israel but by being guided by the Holy Spirit and walking in love. <\/span><\/p>\n\r"
