hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Christians cannot keep the Law. If a believer tried to keep the Law<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> they would find it to be impossible for several reasons. First, if we sacrificed animals to cover our sins, we would be guilty of blasphemy. Second, since the Law was given as a unit, it was not designed to be partially observed. We cannot act as if we are obligated to keep circumcision as Moses’ commandment but not observe the holidays under the Law. Third, much of the Law was given to people who lived in an agrarian society. We would have enormous difficulty “lifting and shifting” the Law as it was written and applying it to our modern culture. This indicates that the Law was given an expiration date. God only intended Israel to observe for a specific period.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Most importantly, believers do not follow the Law because Jesus of Nazareth has fulfilled the Law.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Christ is the end of the Law.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">He is the goal of the Law.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Christ ended the Law.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 2.1250rem; margin-left: 1.2500rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:2.1250rem;margin-left:-2.1250rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Christ makes the Law no longer necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Christ is the Final Destination<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If you have ever ridden a train<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> you understand that a train begins at one point and ends at a distant point with stops along the way. When you come to the end of the line, that’s the point where the train goes no further, and you must exit the train. When Paul writes that Christ is the end of the Law, he is teaching us that <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">faith in Jesus is the final destination for those that have been given the Law to follow.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> Jesus is the last station where everyone gets off the train. There are no station stops beyond faith in Christ, and indeed, the point of the train ride was to bring you to faith in Christ<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> Since Jesus is the destination of the Law, the Law ends with Jesus. It is fulfilled in Christ and finds its expiration in Christ. Jesus says<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">as much:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Matthew 5:17–18<\/span><span style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-weight: bold; color: #833c0b;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">17 “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Luke 24:44 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">44 Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Jesus says that the entirety of Scripture points to him. The Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms are fulfilled in him. What is the purpose of Christ fulfilling the Law and the Prophets?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Romans 3:21–26<\/span><span style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-weight: bold; color: #833c0b;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">New Living Translation (NLT)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">21 But now God has shown us a way to be made right with him without keeping the requirements of the law, as was promised in the writings of Moses and the prophets long ago. 22 We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And this is true for everyone who believes, no matter who<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\">we are.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">23 For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God’s glorious standard. 24 Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins. 25 For God presented Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life, shedding his blood. This sacrifice shows that God was being fair when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past, 26 for he was looking ahead and including them in what he would do in this present time. God did this to demonstrate his righteousness, for he himself is fair and just, and he makes sinners right in his sight when they believe in Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law so that we can be righteous. God executed this glorious plan by offering his Son as a sacrifice. Once this was accomplished, the Law was no longer needed. As we read earlier:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Galatians 3:23–26<\/span><span style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-weight: bold; color: #833c0b;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">23 Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed.24 So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. 25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, 26 for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The believer who believes in Jesus no longer needs the Law. Jesus fulfilled the Law, and our faith in Jesus means we live for God without<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">the Law.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
