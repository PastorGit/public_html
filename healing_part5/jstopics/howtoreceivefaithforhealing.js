hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Now that the key aspects of faith have been thoroughly discussed, it becomes crucial to learn how to nurture and strengthen it to receive divine healing. The solution is quite simple: locate biblical verses that promise healing and meditate on them regularly.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Biblical Meditation<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Biblically speaking, meditation is becoming an engaged, attentive student of Scripture. A person who meditates on divine healing devotes as much attention as possible to learning what the Bible says about healing. That person becomes a detective, a researcher, a reader and a &nbsp;student all in one. You pray as you ask God to direct your studies and reveal spiritual truth to you. <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">Neglecting this discipline of study is the number one reason people fail to receive healing.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Note that this discipline has nothing to do with human merit, intelligence or status. It has to do with determination. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">You do not have to be a pastor to understand what the Bible says about healing.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">You do not have to read the Bible in Greek, Hebrew or Aramaic to understand what the Bible says about divine healing.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">You do not need a Ph.D. to understand what the Bible says about divine healing.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">If you are a child of God, there is nothing wrong with your intelligence. You are not uneducated. You are a child of God indwelt by the eternal Holy Spirit whom the Father has sent to be your teacher.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Therefore, do not make excuses for not studying. God will never bless laziness. I’m going to give you some tough love this morning. Some of you are spiritually lazy. You don’t read, you don’t study, and you complain way too much. This behavior is beneath your high calling in Christ.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">What to Do if You Are Sick<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If you are sick, follow the points below to position yourself to receive healing.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Go to the doctor.<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\"> There is no conflict between seeking medical attention and believing in God. This includes treatment for mental health problems. In ancient Israel, the priest performed many of the functions that doctors performed today. For example, only a priest could declare a person healed of leprosy. If you didn’t see a priest regarding your illness, you would be in disobedience.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.6875rem 3.0000rem 0.2500rem 3.8125rem;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Luke 17:11-14 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.2500rem 3.0000rem 0.5000rem 3.8125rem;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">11 On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. 12 And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance 13 and lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” 14 When he saw them he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went they were cleansed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"margin: 0.3750rem 0 0.3750rem 3.8125rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\">Notice the lepers were healed as they went. Some of us are not receiving healing from God because we are stubborn about going to the doctor.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Follow your doctor\'s advice.<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\"> This is crucial for maintaining good health. Be sure to take your medication as prescribed, schedule regular check-ups, and treat healthcare professionals with respect. It\'s important to remember that they are not adversaries of good.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Incorporating faith as a regular spiritual practice can aid in healing. <\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Just as you consistently take medication to improve your physical health, establishing a spiritual routine of confessing &nbsp;scripture healing promises will facilitate you receiving divine healing. It\'s crucial to continue taking your medication even if you don\'t fully recover after just one dose. Similarly, it\'s vital to maintain trust in God even if you don\'t receive complete healing right away after praying.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Meditate on the finished work of Christ.<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\"> An efficient technique to accelerate divine healing is to focus on the accomplished work of Christ. As you become more acquainted with Jesus\' fulfilled work, it will become effortless to envision being healed through his merit.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Immerse yourself in the healing scriptures found in the Bible.<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\"> These include the Gospel accounts where Jesus healed the sick, the God’s healing promises to the Church in the Epistles, and accounts where God the Father healed people in both the Old and New Testaments.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Maintaining strong faith for healing requires staying clear of negative people, sermons, and situations.<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\"> When feeling unwell, it\'s best to steer clear of TV or radio shows that make you feel upset, anxious, angry, ashamed, or defeated. Avoid engaging in arguments or negative criticism, and don\'t surround yourself with Christians who focus solely on the world\'s problems and sin. Additionally, it\'s crucial to avoid preachers who declare that the possibility of healing has ended.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Cultivate a spirit of gratitude and praise.<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\"> Be thankful for what you have. Learn to rejoice when others are blessed. Thank God when good things happen in the country and the world. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-weight: bold;\">Enjoy laughter and enjoy life.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.6875rem 3.0000rem 0.2500rem 3.8125rem;\"><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,Verdana,sans-serif; font-weight: bold; color: #833c0b;\">Proverbs 17:22 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; margin: 0.2500rem 3.0000rem 0.5000rem 3.8125rem;\"><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,Verdana,sans-serif; color: #833c0b;\">22 A joyful heart is good medicine,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span style=\"font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,Verdana,sans-serif; color: #833c0b;\">  &nbsp; but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 3.4375rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">Good, clean comedy can work wonders in rejuvenating your spirit. <\/span><br \/>\n\r<span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">In the last church I attended, I was shocked that the pastor organized a Christmas party that involved dancing 70s dance music.
