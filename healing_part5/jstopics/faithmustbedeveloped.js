One is based on our righteousness. The other is understanding that God allows us to come into his presence based on the righteousness he has given us in Christ. In the first scenario, I place trust in my holiness and worthiness. In the second scenario, I humbly receive God’s gift of righteousness. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">Receiving grace is not to suggest that God is a petty tyrant who demands that his creatures bow and scrape before him. It is an acknowledgment of reality. Living by grace means I acknowledge the truth that God is infinitely pure, holy, just and pleasing, and I am sinful. I acknowledge that God is the creator of heaven and earth, and I am a creature. In light of this reality, I depend on God to determine how I approach his holiness.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">In the light of this truth, we must embrace the truth that faith is a gift from God independent of my flawed holiness. God gives us faith, not because we are good, but because he is infinitely kind and merciful. Note the passage in The Voice translation.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Ephesians 2:8-9 The Voice (VOICE)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">8-9 For it’s by God’s grace that you have been saved. You receive it through faith. It was not our plan or our effort. It is God’s gift, pure and simple. You didn’t earn it, not one of us did, so don’t go around bragging that you must have done something amazing.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Faith Excludes Boasting<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Closely related to acknowledging that faith is a gift, not a reward for our goodness, is the our inability to boast about having faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Romans 3:27 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">27 Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Apostle Paul tells us that operating in faith excludes boasting. This means that we cannot be proud of our accomplishments as a result of faith. Listen to Jesus:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Luke 18:10-14 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">10 “Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’ 13 But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ 14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In this story, there are two men. One is a religious man; the other is a sinner. The holy man is pompous and proud of his sexual purity, honesty, tithing and fasting. What do all these activities have in common? They involve a form of sacrifice. The Pharisee was proud of his gifts and wanted God to bless him because of them. That is boasting. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">One of the sacrifices the Pharisee was proud of was his tithing. When I was a pastor, there were bitter battles in my congregation about tithing. While I do not believe tithing is a New Testament obligation, I taught there are rational arguments for both sides. Even so, the loudest proponents of tithing did not tithe according to the Scriptures that give the most straightforward instructions on tithing. Second, nearly all of them were proud of their tithing, much like the Pharisee in Luke 18. This is the fallen human nature expressing boasting, pride and hostility toward others. We are not in faith when we use faith as a cloak to disguise boasting, pride and anger.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Faith Works by Love<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Galatians 5:6 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Related to faith being a gift and excluding boasting, is that faith works by love. In the Bible, we are commanded to love our neighbor as we love ourselves. That means that we are commanded to love ourselves. Let me give you a secret. We cannot love ourselves if we do not understand that we are forgiven of all our trespasses. In other words, if I fail to understand the depth of God’s love for me as expressed in the perfect and final sacrifice of Jesus, I will fail to understand why and how to love myself. And if I cannot love myself, I will not be able to love my fellow man. The Apostle is telling us that if we do not walk in love, we will short-circuit our faith. This explains why many of us are failing to receive what God wants us to have.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Faith comes by Reading the Bible<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Romans 10:17 King James Version (KJV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Bible says that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. That is a beautiful expression found in the King James version. It is almost poetic in its lyricism. But we must break down what that means. Paul says that we get faith by reading, studying, meditating on and talking about the Bible. This answers the question of how faith comes. Faith does not come by praying for it, tarrying for it, or going to church. It comes by reading, studying and meditating upon Scripture.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Faith Must be Developed<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Matthew 17:20 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">20 He said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Nearly everything God gives us comes to us as a seed in the kingdom of God. For example, Jesus likens the Word working in our life to how a seed is planted and grows in soil. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Believers often neglect this concept as they seek to receive from God. Often when people pray for healing, they do so out of desperation, without having a minimal understanding of what the Bible says about sickness and divine healing. They want God to answer their prayers based on the urgency of their request rather than faith. Usually, these dear believers are disappointed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">People will often say, “Have faith.” But what does that mean? What it should mean is that you understand faith for a specific thing, such as healing, is developed by reading and meditating on God’s word regarding healing. Faith for mental peace is developed by reading and meditating on God’s word about peace. It takes a long time for an acorn to become a mighty oak tree. Similarly, it takes time to develop robust and immovable faith. Believers usually underestimate how much time and experience they need to develop faith. Further, faith is developed in the crucible of suffering and fiery trials:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">James 1:3 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">1 Peter 4:12 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">12 Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">It\'s important to remember that difficult experiences are often used by God to help us grow as believers. Although these trials can initially be tough to handle, we will eventually be grateful for how they strengthened us. Mistakes are a natural part of the journey towards faith, and even the disciples experienced failures before becoming the powerful Apostles we know from Acts. As facing trials is a crucial aspect of developing our faith, we should expect setbacks along the way. It\'s important to keep in mind that not everyone we pray for will experience divine healing, but this doesn\'t mean we should stop believing in its power.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Faith is a Lifestyle<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Romans 1:17 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Living a Christian life obediently is essential for operating in a vibrant faith. There is no room for half-heartedness when it comes to our relationship with God and His promises. For instance, God has promised to help His people find mates and start families. However, this promise is only extended to those who are actively growing in grace and striving to become disciples of Christ. Men must learn to live a chaste and celibate lifestyle as a single and keep their flesh nature under control. This process of learning how to live holy as a single will benefit them greatly as they learn to live holy as a married person. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Similarly, while accumulating wealth is not necessarily wrong, we must also learn the disciplines of financial moderation and stewardship. We must prove ourselves faithful, content, and generous with small sums of money before God will entrust us with larger sums. It is not true trust in God if we are living in sin or being unfaithful with small sums of money while still trusting Him for a mate or financial prosperity.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
