hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">God is spirit, and we are made in the image of God. You and I are spirit beings who came into being when God imparted the breath or spirit of life to us. When we receive Jesus of Nazareth as our savior, our human spirit is made new. Our old fallen spirit man is replaced with a new, holy spirit recreated in the image of God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">We are Spirit Beings<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">As spirit beings, we connect with Father God with our spirits, not with our intellect and our bodies. Since God is a spirit, we cannot interact with him physically. We cannot touch, see or feel God. Since God is a spirit, we cannot interact with him strictly through our intellect, mainly since our minds are clouded and darkened by sin. Many men and women in the world have great intellects or can do extraordinary feats with their bodies, but they cannot use either to connect with the living God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Faith and the Kingdom<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Believers are citizens of an unseen kingdom called the kingdom of heaven. Although we live on this earth, this earth is not all there is. The kingdom of heaven is a higher plane of existence, and believers on earth engage with the kingdom of heaven by faith. For example, the Bible describes prayer as coming before God’s throne and laying petitions before him. This isn’t something we do physically, but it happens in the spirit realm when we pray. The Bible also says that we are seated with Christ in heavenly places. We are not seated with Christ on earth. However, in the unseen realm of heavenly places, we are seated with Christ in a place of authority and honor. Faith is the substance or spiritual matter we use to comprehend and interact with the kingdom of heaven. By faith, we comprehend God. By faith, we see the heavenly places our physical eyes cannot see; by faith, we exercise authority over unseen, evil spirits. By faith, we receive divine healing from God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Acts 3:16 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">16 And his name—by faith in his name—has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Our text passage tells us that faith was the substance or spiritual material that caused this man to be healed. Jesus completed the work that makes healing possible. Faith is how God’s children receive the healing virtue that is authorized to flow for our benefit because of the authority of Christ.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Faith is a Gift from God<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Ephesians 2:8 King James Version (KJV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Ephesians 2:8 Living Bible (TLB)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">8 Because of his kindness, you have been saved through trusting Christ. And even trusting is not of yourselves; it too is a gift from God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Faith is a gift from God. This is an essential foundational truth that lets me know that: <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.2500rem; margin-left: 1.5000rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:1.2500rem;margin-left:-1.2500rem\">1.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">God wants me to have faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.2500rem; margin-left: 1.5000rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:1.2500rem;margin-left:-1.2500rem\">2.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">That the faith God has given me is not defective or inferior but capable of accomplishing what God intends.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_numbered\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.2500rem; margin-left: 1.5000rem;\"><span class=\"f_numbered\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:1.2500rem;margin-left:-1.2500rem\">3.<\/span><span class=\"f_numbered\">God does not give us faith because of our merit or self-righteousness but because he is good.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">All these numbered points are valid. However, I will focus on the third one because we need a baseline of understanding about this aspect of faith in our church.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
