Often, church people berate other Christians about their families in the following ways:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.3125rem 1.5000rem;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-size:1.09rem; font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">People criticize how we raise our children.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.3125rem 1.5000rem;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-size:1.09rem; font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">People judge our marriages.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.3125rem 1.5000rem;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-size:1.09rem; font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">People disapprovingly scrutinize our family traditions, celebrations and associations.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_body\">This has created deep dissatisfaction and unhappiness in the local church. Instead of being thankful for the family life we have <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\"> we have become bitter about the family life we do not have.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">God is interested in changing you or I more than you or I having the picture perfect home. God wants to teach you how to reach your children, how to reach your spouse, how to reconnect with sibling if you would only listen to him and be willing to change.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">The Christ in Our Local Church<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The way the Lord deals with our natural families mirrors how he deals with the Church as a spiritual family. <\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">The local church is a spiritual family, and the ties are stronger than flesh and blood. Also, local church has a priority of spiritual desires such as having a thriving congregation, a well-attended Sunday school and effective outreach programs.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">However, before the Lord can bring about the external change, that is, provide external growth in our programs, he wants to do a work in each church member\'s inner life. What is God\'s priority is re-ordering our lives most likely will not be our priority. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When I talked to the pastoral committee about being an interim pastor, I said a very foolish thing. I said that I hadn\'t come to make a lot of changes. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Now I know why I said that. I said that because I have a history with this local church, and I had a desire to be a pleasant, no-drama kind of pastor. I wanted the church to move forward and not be distracted by leadership issues. But I have since learned I spoke completely out of turn.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">I wanted Jesus to help me be a nice guy pastor. But then the Lord revealed to me in the Word that I was to be his pastor. I realized that I do not have the right to do what I think is right but to be obedient to his instruction and guidance.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Certainly, church people feel threatened by this, because:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">Like me you have your own understanding of what a pastor should be. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">Like me, you believe your understanding is a settled issue. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">But once a candidate steps into the office of the pastor and Christ begins to give instructions to that person, what may have been settled is now completely unsettled. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The man is only the under shepherd and Jesus is the chief Shepherd, and in the light of his perfection, the man<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: Calibri,Vectora,\'Droid Sans\',\'Open Sans\',Frutiger,sans-serif;\">—<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">if he is wise<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: Calibri,Vectora,\'Droid Sans\',\'Open Sans\',Frutiger,sans-serif;\">—<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">claps his hand over his mouth and says, “Lord, I didn’t understand, I repent in dust and ashes.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Do you remember the man who baptized Saul, Ananias? He is immortalized in Scripture based on what he did on <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">one single day<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">. He obeyed the Lord to go and minister to a young terrorist named Saul.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.5000rem 4.1875rem 1.0000rem 3.0000rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.27rem; font-family: \'Book Antiqua\',Palatino,serif; font-weight: bold; color: #833c0b;\">Acts 9:10<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: Calibri,Vectora,\'Droid Sans\',\'Open Sans\',Frutiger,sans-serif;\">–<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.27rem; font-family: \'Book Antiqua\',Palatino,serif; font-weight: bold; color: #833c0b;\">19 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">10 Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias.” And he said, “Here I am, Lord.” 11 And the Lord said to him, <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">“Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying, 12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.” <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\">13 But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem. 14 And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.” 15 But the Lord said to him, <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">“Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. 16 For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.” <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\">17 So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” 18 And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized; 19 and taking food, he was strengthened.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The early church had thought a lot about Saul. They probably had talked a lot about what they wanted the Lord to do to Saul. Ananias was a part of those discussions. He told the Lord that he had heard a lot about Saul of Tarsus. But notice, that the last thing on Ananias’ mind was Saul becoming a Christian, must less a minister of the Gospel. And the second to last thing on his mind, was that Ananias would be the one to lay his hands on Saul to bring Saul a blessing!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Note that Ananias was a spiritual person. The Bible calls him a disciple. When the Holy Spirit calls you a disciple, then you have bona fides. He was a godly person, but he was dead wrong about Saul. When Jesus spoke to him in a vision, the Lord revealed himself differently than what Ananias expected. Ananias had a choice: either to believe Jesus for as he is and be obedient, or to reject the Lord based on his own understanding of what Jesus should or should not be doing with Saul.

He had to come to faith; he had to learn to accept the Lord for who he was and what he wanted to do.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">All Ananias had to do was to be obedient. All he had to do was to shed his wrong understanding and just do what Jesus said to do. And by doing so, by being obedient on that one day, he is immortalized in Scripture.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
