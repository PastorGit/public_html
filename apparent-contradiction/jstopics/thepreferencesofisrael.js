When Jesus appeared to a subjugated Israel, the common people accepted him as he was, and the religious people were offended. After Christ revealed himself as the Savior of the Gentiles, some Jewish Christians rejoiced, and others became offended. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We think we<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
