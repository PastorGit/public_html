In the last message, we read that Peter and John healed a 40-year-old man crippled from birth. We learned that the cause of recovery was not the righteousness of Peter and John but faith in the name of Jesus. In this message, we will explore the significance of the name of Jesus. Many scholars believe our text passage to be a hymn of the early church. You will find that in Paul’s writings and sermons, he often quotes hymns or poems. This hymn is saturated with the doctrinal truth of the deity of Jesus and the power in his name. &nbsp;We should read passages from John 1 as we look at Philippians 2. You will see that the Apostle John and the Apostle Paul wrote the same things about Jesus of Nazareth.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">John 1:1–3 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">John 1:14 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">The Apostle John explains to us in the beginning the Word already was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. In the beginning, Jesus of Nazareth was not. He didn’t exist in the beginning. In the beginning were the Father and Son (and of course, the Holy Spirit, but John doesn’t reference him yet). As part of the Father’s great plan of redemption, the Son takes on human flesh. The Word enters the human race by being born a human. In doing so, the Word becomes fully human without laying aside his divinity. Now he does lay aside his divine rights and privileges and his exalted status. Theologians call this transition from glory to humanity a divine condescension. When the Word is born of the virgin Mary, the Word is called Jesus of Nazareth. &nbsp;Jesus of Nazareth is a combination of God and unfallen man. He has the nature of God and the unfallen nature of man in one person. &nbsp; He is not like other humans because he is sinless. He is like other humans in that he gets hungry, gets tired, and laughs at a good joke. When we read the Gospel, we see that Jesus’s exhibited a range of emotions. He never sinned, but he became frustrated, angry, and wept. Jesus had to become a man and have a human body because it was the only way he could pay the price for our sins. Jesus took our sins in his body when he was crucified. The blood he shed had to be authentic human blood. The life that expired on the cross had to be a human life. To accomplish the Father’s plan, the Word had to become a human person.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Raised Up<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">After Jesus of Nazareth died on the cross, the spirit of Jesus went to Sheol, not the fires of hell, but Sheol, awaiting the Father to reunite the Word with the body of Jesus in the resurrection.

If the Father didn’t raise Jesus, the Son would have been abandoned to Hades. This is a complete hypothetical because the Father did raise Jesus of Nazareth from the dead. In the resurrection, the spirit of the Son was reunited with the body of Jesus of Nazareth. That is the concept of all human resurrections. The spirit and the body are reunited because the body without the spirit is just a lifeless shell.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">James 2:26 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The resurrected Jesus had a unique, glorified body.

In raising Jesus from the dead bodily, God declares to the universe that the man Jesus of Nazareth was sinless and, therefore, he is unworthy of death. After the resurrection, Father God bequeaths Jesus a name that is above every other name or authority in creation. In the name of Jesus, is all the authority of heaven and earth. Additionally, Father God declares open to all of creation that Jesus of Nazareth is God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<div style=\"text-align: left; text-indent: 0; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0.6875rem 3.0000rem 0.2500rem 3.0000rem;\"><table style=\"border:none;border-spacing:0;padding:0;line-height: normal;\"><tr style=\"vertical-align:baseline\"><td style=\"border:none;padding:0;width:1.1250rem\"><img id=\"toggle0186a2_ICON\" class=\"dropdown-toggle-icon\" alt=\"hmtoggle_plus0\" style=\"margin:0;width:0.5625rem;height:0.5625rem;border:none\" src=\".\/images\/hmtoggle_plus0.gif\"\/><\/td><td style=\"border:none;padding:0\"><span class=\"f_scripture\"><a id=\"toggle0186a2_LINK\" class=\"dropdown-toggle\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-type=\"dropdown\" data-state=\"0\" data-icon=\"toggle0186a2_ICON\" data-src0=\".\/images\/hmtoggle_plus0.gif\" data-src1=\".\/images\/hmtoggle_plus1.gif\">Hebrews 1:8-9<\/a><\/span><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/div>\n\r<div id=\"toggle0186a2\" class=\"dropdown-toggle-body\" style=\"text-align: left; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid; padding: 0 0 0 0; margin: 0.6875rem 3.0000rem 0.2500rem 4.1250rem;display:none\"><table style=\"border:none; border-spacing:0;\">\n\r<tr>\n\r<td style=\"vertical-align:top; padding:0; border:none\"><p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 1:8–9 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">8 But of the Son he says,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">9 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">therefore God, your God, has anointed you<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<\/td>\n\r<\/tr>\n\r<\/table>\n\r<\/div>\n\r<p class=\"p_emphasis\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\">The Father is proclaiming that Jesus (the Word made flesh), is God in the same manner as the pre-existent Word is God!<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
