David is a towering figure in Scripture, and from Scripture we learn about the incredible highs of David’s life and all also the dark, deep pits of tragedy and despair he also endured. Truly, he is a remarkable figure whose life the Holy Spirit has used to bring instruction and encouragement to the Church.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">David had many dark moments in his life, including, the death of his child that he had with Bathsheba, the death of his son Absalom who betrayed him, the rape of his daughter Tamar and the loss of thousands of Hebrew lives because of David’s disobedience to the Lord in taking a census. These were all times of intense anguish for David.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">But undoubtedly, the period when David was fleeing King Saul was a very long and very dark time in David’s life. What happened was that God anoints David king over Israel as a teenager. The only problem is that Israel already has a king named Saul. God chooses David over Saul because Saul was disobedient, and Saul therefore tries to kill David in order to remove his rival. David, who asked for none of this, spends the better part of seven years running for his life from Saul, living in the desert, in caves and in foreign countries, trying desperately to stay alive while Saul sends his massive army to hunt him down.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Bible scholars believe that, at a minimum, five Psalms were written while David was fleeing Saul. These include Psalm 7, 27, 31, 34, 52. It is harder to determine when Psalm 22 was written, but it reasonable to assume it was written either when David was fleeing Saul or during an equally distressing period in David’s life.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<h3 style=\"margin: 1.1875rem 0 1.1875rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.27rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-weight: bold;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\',sans-serif;\">© Pastor Paul Cooper || <a href=\"http:\/\/www.b-wcc.org\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"weblink\">www.b-wcc.org<\/a> ||<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 0.73rem; font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\',sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/b-wcc.org\/scripturecopyright.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"weblink\"> Scripture Use Copyright<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r"
