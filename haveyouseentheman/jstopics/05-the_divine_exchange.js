He was the only man to do that. He was the only man to fulfill ever jot and tittle of the Law and therefore stand before God as perfectly righteous. We, on the other hand, were unable to keep even one comma of the Law, so we stood condemned before God as perfectly unrighteous.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">On the cross, this righteous Jesus took in his own body our sins, and bore the punishment for our sins in his crucifixion. The full measure of God’s wrath and indignation over our terrible sins was endured by Jesus, so that the full measure of his perfect righteousness that God required could be transferred to us. Let’s let the Scripture bear out this divine exchange of our sin to Jesus and Jesus’ righteousness to us:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\" style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-weight: normal; color: #000000;\">1 Peter 2:24 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #000000;\">24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\" style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-weight: normal; color: #000000;\">2 Corinthians 5:17,21 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #000000;\">17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 21 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Do you see the connection? We are the sinners; Jesus is the righteous. On the cross, Jesus bears our sin and suffers the penalty for them which is death. And in bearing our sin, and enduring God’s punishment for our sin, Christ’s righteousness becomes ours and we receive pardon instead of judgment, divine life instead of spiritual death.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\',sans-serif;\">© Pastor Paul Cooper || <a href=\"http:\/\/www.b-wcc.org\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"weblink\">www.b-wcc.org<\/a> ||<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 0.73rem; font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\',sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/b-wcc.org\/scripturecopyright.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"weblink\"> Scripture Use Copyright<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r"
