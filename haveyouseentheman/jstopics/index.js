More and more, the “thanks” in Thanksgiving has been phased out, and the day has become a day of feasting, football watching and a pause before the shopping sprees begin.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">But it wasn’t always so. I remember when Thanksgiving was a momentous holiday. A time of massive preparation for the all-important family get together. And in my family at least, there was always that pause, not to plan a Black Friday shopping strategy, but to truly give thanks for God’s blessings.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">For the first Christians who came to these shores many years ago, Thanksgiving was a time of thankfulness in the midst of sorrow and trials. The Europeans had come to the New World seeking a new land where they could worship God freely. Unfamiliar with environment, they had to endure many trials and sufferings. They lost loved ones, including children, to sickness. They experienced hunger and shortage, and constantly faced the fear of the unknown. Had it not been for the kindness and compassion of the tribes living in the land, our European brothers and sisters would have perished.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">The theme of thanksgiving amidst suffering was evident in my family during this holiday period as well. By the time I was born, the matriarch on my mother’s side of the family, Aunt Mattie, had long since buried two husbands, and even had buried her grown son, who was murdered. My grandmother and aunts all had their share of loss and grief to deal with as well. The holidays were a hard time for them as they had to contemplate their loved ones who had passed on too soon. And yet, they found hope in the Lord their God and laughter in the family that surrounded them.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">In Scripture, thanksgiving and sorrow often go hand in hand. Perhaps 2016 has been a long, tough year for you and your family. Perhaps this upcoming holiday season brings a deep sense of loneliness and even sorrow as you contemplate the loved ones who have passed. If so, I believe the message today will be one of encouragement.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\',sans-serif;\">© Pastor Paul Cooper || <a href=\"http:\/\/www.b-wcc.org\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"weblink\">www.b-wcc.org<\/a> ||<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 0.73rem; font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\',sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/b-wcc.org\/scripturecopyright.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"weblink\"> Scripture Use Copyright<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r"
