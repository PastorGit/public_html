hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 1.1875rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">The episode that gives us Psalm 22 teaches us that God gives us vision in our suffering. The prophets of old had visions of the Lord, but they also went through tests and trials. I’m not saying that one is dependent on the other, however, I am offering that sometimes the two go hand in hand. When we reach out to the Lord in our suffering, he gives us special sight. The Holy Spirit causes us to be “woke”.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-style: normal; color: #000000;\">Young people use the term “woke” as knowing what is going on, being able to discern the real story that is underneath the accepted narrative. In a social urban context, “woke” means understanding what is happening to your community based on your real experience and not what the media is telling you. It is seeing beyond the obvious. The implication is that people who are oppressed or suffering have a vision that is more authentic than those who have grown fat in their privilege and comfort.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-style: normal; color: #000000;\">The way I am using the term goes beyond the earthly, temporal grievances of a community. Enduring testing and trials unto the Lord allows us to receive divine perspective, allows us to stay “spiritually woke.”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">So what is the clarity that David, in his suffering and trial, gained from seeing a vision of this suffering man?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<h3 style=\"margin: 1.1875rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.27rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-weight: bold;\">God has Suffered<\/span><\/h3>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 1.1875rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">First, Psalm 22 shows us that God has suffered. This is an important point. Too often we see the Father aloof from our sufferings. Since he is holy and high he can seem distant from our earthly problems. How can one so majestic seated on a glorious throne, being attended to by a multitude of majestic angels really feel what I feel?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">The cross answers this question conclusively. Jesus is God in human flesh. Jesus is God come into the world. Jesus was fully God and also fully man. He got tired. He sweated. He grew hungry. Jesus knows what it is to be betrayed, to lose loved ones, to feel abandoned. He knows what it is to be tempted by sin. In Jesus, God suffered and endured the human condition.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<h3 style=\"margin: 1.1875rem 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000;\">God Suffered for Us<\/span><\/h3>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 1.1875rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Second, Psalm 22 points to a Savior that suffered for us. Like many messianic prophecies, Psalm 22, gives only a glimpse of God’s plan of redemption. It’s a puzzle piece that fits together with other Old Testament Scripture to give us a vision of Christ. As a Hebrew, David understood that the man he saw was Messiah suffering for him!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">It is not enough to know that Jesus suffered. It is not enough Jesus understands our problems and our needs. Jesus suffered for us, to redeem us, and to make us righteous.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Let’s look at this:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Galatians 3:13-14 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree”— 14 so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #000000;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">Now if you have been coming to this church, you know what the blessing of Abraham is. By way of review the blessing of Abraham is righteousness. Let’s read a little deeper in Galatians:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\" style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-weight: normal; color: #000000;\">Galatians 3:1-14 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #000000;\">3 O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. 2 Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? 3 Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? 4 Did you suffer so many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain? 5 Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith— 6 just as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #000000;\">7 Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. 8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” 9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0 0;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; color: #000000;\">13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree”— 14 so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"margin: 0.8750rem 0 0.3125rem 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">This passage is saying very clearly that God justified Abraham by faith. Another way to say that is that when Abraham believed God, God made him righteous. To be justified means to have your sins forgiven and to stand before God just as if you had never sinned. To be made righteous by God means that God makes you right with him. You are not only forgiven of your sin, but entered into God’s family. God made Abraham righteous by faith, and God makes us righteous by faith.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\"><span style=\"font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\',sans-serif;\">© Pastor Paul Cooper || <a href=\"http:\/\/www.b-wcc.org\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"weblink\">www.b-wcc.org<\/a> ||<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 0.73rem; font-family: \'Trebuchet MS\',sans-serif;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/b-wcc.org\/scripturecopyright.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"weblink\"> Scripture Use Copyright<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r"
