hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Man is a spirit being and our human spirit is the part of us that is immortal. For example, &nbsp;Luke 16:23-26 tells the story of the rich man Dives and the poor man Lazarus. Both men died, but their spirits lived on in Hades. Lazarus ended up on the good side of Hades called Abraham’s bosom or Paradise. This is where all the Old Testaments saints like David, and Moses and Jeremiah were. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">However, Dives ended up on the bad side of Hades in a place where there were flames and torment. This is a holding place for the wicked until the final day of judgment. These two compartments of Hades were separated by a great gulf.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">My point to you in this teaching was that that the human spirit is indestructible. It is not destroyed by the death of the physical body nor is it is not destroyed by hellfire.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Jesus of Nazareth was a spirit being too! When he died, Matthew said that Jesus gave up his spirit, which simply means, he died. Jesus’s physical body expired, and his Spirit, that is the Spirit of God the Son, was released from his body. Jesus’s spirit didn’t die, but the physical body of Jesus expired and was buried in a tomb.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
