hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The Gospels are careful to record that Jesus’s entire life is a fulfillment of Old Testament Scripture (remember our first connector?). Where he was born, how he was born, the lineage of Joseph and Mary were all divinely orchestrated to fulfill Scripture. The timing of the very unusual events in Jesus’s life, such as the arrival of the Magi, his family fleeing to Egypt, Herod’s attempt to kill him, his settling in Galilee are all are fulfillment of prophecies. Importantly, Jesus recognizes that the most important prophecy he must fulfill is to die on a cross and to be raised back to life. Hebrews summarizes Jesus’s insight this way:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 10:5–10 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">5 Consequently, &nbsp;when Christ came into the world, he said,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">but a body have you prepared for me;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">6 in burnt offerings and sin offerings<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">you have taken no pleasure.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">7 Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’”<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">8 When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), &nbsp;9 then he added, &nbsp;“Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. 10 And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The whole reason why God the Son became Jesus of Nazareth, the whole reason why he became a human being, is so that he <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">as Jesus<\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\" style=\"font-size: 1.27rem;\">, <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">could offer up his body as an offering for sin.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The concept of animal sacrifice is simple. You transfer the guilt of a person to an innocent animal, and you slay the animal to signify the temporary removal of sin of the guilty person.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Since people are worth more than animals, if an innocent person stood in for a guilty person, and died for that guilty person, justice is satisfied. The sin is not covered, but totally expunged because one human died for another. It’s like for like. The problem is there are no innocent people in God’s eyes because all mankind is born in sin and shaped in iniquity. Except Jesus. Jesus being fully God and fully man, is the only man who is sinless. And his sole purpose was to offer himself as the sacrifice that stands in for all of mankind to take our sins. Because Jesus is sinless and human he can stand in for another human and totally remove the guilt of that person.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">However, because Jesus is a synthesis of God and human, he can stand in for the entire human race. The expanse of God in Jesus can cover the iniquity of every person that has ever lived, lives now, and will live in the future. In other words, on the cross, God the Father can rightfully transfer the sins of humanity on to the body of Jesus of Nazareth.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Because Jesus is authentically human, the divine justice of God can be meted out on his physical body. This is what the scourging, the mocking, the crucifixion, the agony, bloodshed is all about. Jesus had to suffer in his physical body for the Law of God to be satisfied.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Finally, because Jesus is God, he can endure the full fury of God’s wrath. As we have discussed, Jesus is not enduring the horror of my sin and God’s anger at just anger at my sin. He is enduring the Father’s hot fury at the iniquity of multiplied billions of humans. Only the God-man, Jesus, could endure that kind of stress. But God in human form could only endure it for a while.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
