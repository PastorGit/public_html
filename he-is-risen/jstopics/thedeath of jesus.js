hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When Jesus of Nazareth dies on the cross, he cries out, “My God, My God why have you forsaken me?” It was because on the cross, God the Father turned his back on Jesus of Nazareth as part of the suffering Jesus had to endure paying for our sins as if he had committed them. <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">On the cross, Jesus experienced what it meant to be cursed of God, and he experienced the collective curse meant for the entire human race! <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">This suffering, pain and torment killed Jesus!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">It so important that we get this. Jesus of Nazareth, the man who was born of a woman, yet 100% God the Son, DIED on the cross. The death Jesus died was the same death that every other human being tasted up to that time.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
