hmBody:"<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Philippians 2:4–8 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">4 Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. 5 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, &nbsp;6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, &nbsp;7 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, &nbsp;being born in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, &nbsp;even death on a cross.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">God is infinite. However, the Father’s plan was for God the Son to take on human flesh, that is, become a human being. How does an infinite God become a finite man? As Solomon noted:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">1 Kings 8:27 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">27 “But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, &nbsp;heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_emphasis\">God the Son<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> became man by emptying Himself. God the Son emptied himself not of his divinity, but of his divine weight and glory so that he could tabernacle in human flesh, that is, become fully human.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When Mary and Joseph held the baby Jesus, they held a manifestation of the Son of God <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">that had not previously existed<\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\" style=\"font-size: 1.27rem;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> They held the incarnate God! They held a baby, helpless as it was, <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">that was fully God and fully man.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Fully God and fully man does not mean that Jesus had a split personality. Jesus did not walk around hearing two voices in his head, one voice of God and the other voice of man. Fully God and fully man rather means that Jesus of Nazareth was the perfect and inseparable synthesis of God and man. It was the complete intertwining of God the Son’s DNA and Mary’s DNA through the power of God the Holy Spirit.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Jesus was not a mere man who had an exceptionally close relationship with God. Nor was Jesus God who had somehow shapeshifted his form to appear as a man. Jesus was a unique creation, the fruit of divine seed and a human womb. <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">As such he was a perfect man, fully God, fully human and sinless.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
