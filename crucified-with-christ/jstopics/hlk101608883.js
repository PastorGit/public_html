Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? 2 By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? 3 Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">5 For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. 6 We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. 7 For one who has died has been set free from sin. 8 Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 9 We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. 10 For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. 11 So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. 13 Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. 14 For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.5000rem 0.1875rem;\"><a id=\"crucifiedwithchrist\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.64rem; font-family: \'Franklin Gothic Book\'; font-weight: bold; color: #0000ff;\">Crucified with Christ<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We have been looking at the cross in different ways, and one way to look at the cross is through the lens of identity. We became sinners through our identification with Adam. Adam sinned<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> and sin spread through all mankind. God freed us from sin through our identification with Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus died on the cross<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> and through his punishment and death, God pardoned our sins and freed us from sin’s dominion.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Paul says our old self has been crucified with Christ. This is part of our identification with Christ. The term “old self” refers to our old spirit man. Our spirit is what became new when we became new creatures in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17). The old spirit man was the slave to sin<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> and we inherited our sin nature from our father Adam (Rom. 5:12–14)<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When we identified with Jesus, our old spirit man was nailed to the cross and died, and we received a new spirit from the Father. All our sins—past, present, and future—were washed away, and, therefore, we are free from the Law’s condemnation because Christ bore the punishment for our transgressions.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 1.0000rem 0.1875rem;\"><a id=\"whyarewetempted\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.45rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: #527e34;\">Why Are We Tempted?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">This raises the question, why do believers sin? The answer is that we are not fully redeemed. That is to say, our minds and bodies have not been glorified as our spirit man has been, and therefore, the sin nature entices us to sin through the passions and cravings of our mental and bodily desires<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> Also, Satan can tempt us to sin. However, while a believer can be tempted to sin, they are no longer enslaved to sin and can resist both the cravings of the flesh nature in their members and the temptations of Satan. Being victorious in this area takes disciplined devotion to God.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 1.0000rem 0.1875rem;\"><a id=\"hopeforthebackslider\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.45rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: #527e34;\">Hope for the Backslider<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When a believer sins, it doesn’t mean they didn’t get saved or lost salvation; it means they yielded to the temptation of their flesh or were deceived by the enemy. If believers do not mature in their walk with Christ and abide in the Word, they will continually be defeated by sin and the enemy.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Backsliders have been caught in the trap of sin<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> much like an animal is caught in the jaws of a predator. I watched a documentary about the wildlife that had to cross a great river in Africa as part of their migration to greener pastures<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> Their problem was the crossing point was full of hungry crocodiles. Although the crocodiles have mighty jaws, they had trouble hanging onto the larger animals like large Wildebeests or the stronger Zebras they caught. However, the small antelopes, many the size of large dogs, didn’t stand a chance against the crocodiles. As soon as they jumped in the water, the crocodiles were upon them, quickly crushing them in their bone-crushing jaws.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Many backsliders are like small antelopes who jump into the river of sin full of demonic crocodiles ready to attack them spiritually. Perhaps they have gotten into relationships, made business deals or decisions<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> or formed habits that have led them into situations they cannot handle. The enemy may have deceived them that God has forsaken them, and they don’t have enough knowledge of the scripture to understand that sin’s power has been broken over their lives.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 1.0000rem 0.1875rem;\"><a id=\"paulsadvicetomastersin\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.45rem; font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: #527e34;\">Paul’s Advice to Master Sin<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In our text, the Apostle Paul gives instructions on how we can master sin.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">Romans 6:11 So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Considering yourself dead to sin doesn’t mean you will never sin or that you won’t be tempted. You understand that sin no longer dominates and controls you spiritually. Since your spirit man has been set free from the controlling power of sin, you need to affirm this truth constantly. We demonstrate this truth by meditating on this spiritual truth regularly (Josh. 1:8).<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">Romans 6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Because you are not dominated by sin, you have to resist the urge to sin mentally and physically. This will be challenging, especially when it comes to addictions and habits. However, you have the power of the Holy Spirit to help you! To travel this point further, this is probably the area that confuses many believers. Since sinful habits are challenging to overcome, and often believers are not delivered instantly, the church community begins to wonder if a believer struggling with habits is saved. However, we need to remind ourselves that people fighting habits are in a spiritual war!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">On occasion<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> we read about famous ministers who have sinned. Often, these men or women of God have been dealing with cravings and addictions. Believers usually jump to the conclusion that these ministers were never really saved in the first place. Only God knows a person’s heart, but based on the teachings of the New Testament, it is pretty likely the minister had lost a <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">battle<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> in their <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">war<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> against sin. It doesn’t mean they didn’t receive the new birth in the first place, and the body of Christ will have to decide if they are going to throw stones or not.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">Romans 6:13 Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">One way to have victory over sinful habits is to get busy serving God. Satan is a master deceiver and will try to convince us that we do not have time to help in the house of God. However, we all have room in our schedules to serve the Lord!<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
