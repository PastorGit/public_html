hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The apostles did not go to war and kill giants, but they carried out exploits of another kind. Paul, Barnabas, Silas, and Timothy preached the Gospel and evangelized cities. Philip, Peter and John turned Samaria inside out with the power of God. For each apostle<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> however, there would come a time when the mighty anointing of God to turn cities upside down would not flow in the same way. Jesus told Peter this:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">John 21:18<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">19 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">18 Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.&quot; 19 (This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, &quot;Follow me.&quot;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Peter 1:12<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">15 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">12 Therefore I intend always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in the truth that you have. 13 I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by way of reminder, 14 since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me. 15 And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Likewise, Paul wrote:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Timothy 4:1<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Cambria;\">–<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">12 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">4 I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: 2 preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. 3 For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, 4 and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. 5 As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. 7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 8 Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">9 Do your best to come to me soon. 1<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">0 <\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\">For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 11 Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is very useful to me for ministry. 12 Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Both Peter and Paul experienced a change in their ministry. Jesus told Peter that would die in suffering. Paul too, was aware that he would be making a transition to glory. Like David, winter had come to the lives and ministries of Peter and Paul. God has miraculously delivered both Peter and Paul from prison in the glory days gone by, but both would die as martyrs as prisoners of Rome. Why had the Lord not delivered them from their captors one last time? The clue is in the Scriptures we read. Peter and Paul had spent their ministries investing in the lives of faithful men and women who would take up the mantle of preaching, teaching and discipleship. These men\'s last and final work would be to contribute to the documentation of the messages and experiences God had given them. Their final work, completed in aged weakness<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> was to do their part to write Scripture.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Peter and Paul had trained faithful men and women so that they could finish that last assignment. If there were no John Mark, there would have been no Gospel of Mark, or 1 and 2 Peter, narrated to John Mark by Peter. If there had been no Silas and Luke<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> there would not have been a book of Acts or any of the Epistles we cherish today. Both Peter and Paul needed a revelation of their limitations and weaknesses because they would have otherwise been blind to the timing of their season of transition.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><a id=\"transitioninthechurch\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">Transition in the Church<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We can see that God desires transition in his corporate church. However, that transition is possible only when a new generation is properly trained and raised. We also see that even the great heroes of faith needed God to show them when he was transitioning them and moving them on, either by allowing them to experience weakness and loss or by direct revelation. Transition is difficult to accept, particularly when it signals growing old or becoming weak. We must learn to accept this season of winter with grace.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">As I develop this thought, I want to emphasize that I am not merely talking about growing old. We can become weak and need to transition for other reasons such as dramatic changes in our health or relationships. Truthfully, church history suggests that only one of Jesus\'s apostles, the apostle John, lived to old age. Therefore, my message is not about growing old as it is about dealing with weakness.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">There is a time in our Christian service when we all become tired, and they become exhausted during battle when their ministry assignment ends. The end is not always a physical death, but it is an end to that assignment. Let us transition properly. We do this by acknowledging that God\'s design is that our outer body perishes. As Paul wrote:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Corinthians 4:16 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">16 So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">It is foolish to think you and I can remain untouched by age. Since neither our minds nor bodies are fully redeemed, it makes sense that both will eventually wither and perish. God\'s design for the local church is that older believers mentor and disciple young Christians to take their place in the ministry. He plans that while we yet live, we can pass the baton to the next generation of godly leaders while God moves us into a different assignment and chapter of our service to him.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Every person active and involved in this church can pass their knowledge, wisdom and skill to someone else. We need people ready to learn and be discipled, by leaders who have the character and patience to instruct others faithfully<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Notes\"><span class=\"f_Notes\"><a href=\"javascript:ScrollTop();\" class=\"scriptlink\">Go to top<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r"
