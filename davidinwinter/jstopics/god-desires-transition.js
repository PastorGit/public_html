hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">One truth we can learn is that God wanted to pass the mantle of David\'s fighting ability to his commanders while David still lived. God wanted a changing of the guard, a transition of David\'s leadership and responsibility to others that David had trained. God wanted the transition to happen before David died.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">God could have caused David to triumph over the second giant as he caused him to triumph over the first giant. But the Lord was signaling to David and his commanders that the time for transition had begun. The method God used to communicate this message was to expose David\'s weakness and age. David applied this principle to grooming his son Solomon to succeed him as king.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">People of faith are usually blind to their weaknesses. When God uses us in the past<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> we assume he will continue to use us and grant us victory upon victory in the future. This tendency to not discern our weakness is characteristic of human nature. When God\'s powerful anointing for victory is no longer present in our lives as before<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> this is God\'s sign to us that we are in a season of transition.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
