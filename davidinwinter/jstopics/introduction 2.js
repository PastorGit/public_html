hmBody:"<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Samuel 21:15–21 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">15 There was war again between the Philistines and Israel, and David went down together with his servants, and they fought against the Philistines. And David grew weary. 16 And Ishbi-benob, one of the descendants of the giants, whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of bronze, and who was armed with a new sword, thought to kill David. 17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid and attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then David\'s men swore to him, &quot;You shall no longer go out with us to battle, lest you quench the lamp of Israel.&quot;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">18 After this there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was one of the descendants of the giants. 19 And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite, struck down Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver\'s beam. 20 And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended from the giants. 21 And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David\'s brother, struck him down.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">David was a man of exploits. He killed a lion and a bear as a boy tending his father\'s sheep (1 Samuel 17:34–36). A full-grown lion can weigh up to 400 pounds, are lightning-quick and known to kill men. Bears can weigh up to 600 pounds and are strong and deceptively fast. Most professional athletes could not outrun a bear running at top speed. David killed Goliath, a human giant whose tribe had mysterious origins and superhuman strength. David was a warrior, who as one man, could destroy a platoon of enemy soldiers. In every way, David was a triumphant warrior king.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Before David became king and was hunted by King Saul, the first king of Israel, David gathered to himself a gang of men, mostly society\'s outcasts, who later become his generals and commanders. David not only taught them war but also God imparted to those men a victorious battle spirit. The longer these men associated with David, the stronger God\'s anointing on them to do exploits grew. A select group of these men became so highly skilled, fearless<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> and able to do wonders on the battlefield that they became known as David\'s mighty men. They are described in 2 Samuel 21 and 23. Let us read about one of them, Abishai:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Samuel 23:18–19 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">18 Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against three hundred men and killed them and won a name beside the three. 19 He was the most renowned of the thirty and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Abishai was a supernaturally proficient warrior, and he was the one who came to David\'s aid against the monster giant. As a result of this conflict, David\'s men would not let David fight in battle. As a result, David transitioned from warrior king to elder statesman. However, because David had done well in training his men, and Jehovah God had transferred David\'s victorious spirit to his men, no vacuum of might or bravery was created when David stopped fighting the Lord\'s battles on the battlefield. Indeed, God had shaped and formed an army of men just like David! David planned well for his transition from warrior to elder king.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
