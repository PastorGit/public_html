hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The third truth we can glean from this episode is that David could not have moved into his role as the elder statesman and the king who would pave the way for Solomon\'s glory unless he had groomed others to follow in his footsteps.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">David had been a poor shepherd boy from a poor Israelite family. God promoted him to be one of the most powerful and wealthiest men on earth. However, David\'s greatest wealth was in the form of the men to whom he imparted his greatness. These men would enable him to move even higher in God and continue to be an instrument to carry out God\'s purposes. Why? Because David no longer had to fight on the battlefield. He had successfully duplicated himself to now focus on the next assignment God had for him.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">As believers<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> it is easy to forget that our legacy is not in material things. Often successful businesspeople will point to the objects of their success<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> such as the first automobile, a rocket ship, a mobile phone or a quality control process. When we study the lives of these visionaries, we often find that these men were willing to sacrifice the integrity of relationships for their goal to perfect their inventions. However, for the believer, our earthly legacy is <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">people<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif; font-style: italic;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> Paul wrote:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Philippians 4:1 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">4 Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">For Paul, the believers he led to the Lord were his legacy. Interestingly, Paul never talked about any buildings he built or any governance documents he wrote. He may have done all those things too, but the object of his work was building people<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> not buildings.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
