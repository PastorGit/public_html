And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">&quot;He Himself took our infirmities<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">And bore our sicknesses.&quot;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">1 Peter 2:21–25 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">21 For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. 22 He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. 23 When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. 24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. 25 For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">This is our second message on healing. We looked at this text scripture in Isaiah 53. We learned that Isaiah 53 is a prophecy about Jesus of Nazareth. And we found that Matthew and Peter quote this passage in their New Testament writings. They interpret this passage to prove that he carried our physical illness and pains through His redemptive work. At this point, we must note that some Christians do not believe in divine healing. They think that Isaiah 53 refers not to physical illness but spiritual sickness. Their position points us to a larger question. <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">How do we correctly identify and explain prophecies about Jesus? <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">For example, let\'s look at Isaiah 7:14:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Isaiah 7:14 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Isaiah prophesies that Jesus will be born of a virgin. However, some scholars argue that the Hebrew word for &quot;virgin&quot; could be translated as &quot;woman.&quot; Therefore, how do we know the correct interpretation is &quot;virgin?&quot; Let\'s look at a passage in Matthew:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Matthew 1:18–23 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. 19 And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. 20 But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &quot;Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21 She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.&quot; 22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">23 &quot; Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">  &nbsp; and they shall call his name Immanuel&quot;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">(which means, God with us).<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span class=\"f_body\">Believers understand that the proper interpretation of Isaiah 7:14 is that the Messiah (Immanuel) will be born of a virgin because Matthew\'s gospel explicitly tells us that this is the meaning. Similarly, we believe that Isaiah 53 speaks about Jesus providing healing through his finished redemptive work because passages in Matthew and 1 Peter confirm that truth. <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">How do we know these passages in Matthew and 1 Peter are correct and the counterarguments of historians, scholars and theologians are incorrect?<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The answer is simple. After God, the Father raised Jesus from the dead, Jesus stayed with his disciples for forty days, teaching them how he fulfilled Bible prophecies. From Genesis and through Malachi\'s end, Jesus explained the Messianic prophecies and how he fulfilled them. He used Scripture to trace his lineage and connected the prophecies about his death, burial, and resurrection. Let\'s look at a different example:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Matthew 2:14–15 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">14 And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt 15 and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, &quot; Out of Egypt I called my son.&quot;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In this passage, Matthew is quoting Hosea 11:1 which reads:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hosea 11:1 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">When Israel was a child, I loved him,<\/span><br \/>\n\r<span class=\"f_scripture\">  &nbsp; and out of Egypt I called my son.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">How did Matthew know this prophecy in Hosea was about Jesus of Nazareth and referred explicitly to when Jesus\'s parents departed Egypt? Matthew knew this because Jesus told him. Indeed, that was the only way Matthew could see this information. We know that Jesus\'s teaching was supernatural. His words were imprinted on their hearts when the resurrected Jesus taught his disciples (see Luke 24:13–35). After Jesus ascended, the Apostles proclaimed these truths first to the nation of Israel. If you look at Peter and Paul\'s recorded sermons in Acts, you will see they are loaded with prophetic references. The Bible passages that Peter and Paul quote in support of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus are the truths that Jesus taught them. In time, the disciples of Christ recorded these words, and the written record became the New Testament. People try to say that the Bible is just a book written by men to oppress other people. Not true! The Bible is the inspired Word of God that proceeded from God\'s mouth:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Timothy 3:16–17 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">16 All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">2 Peter 1:20–21 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">20 knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone\'s own interpretation. 21 For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We do not believe that God exists because we can feel God in our hearts. We believe that God exists because God said, &quot;I AM that I AM.&quot; We don\'t think that Jesus is raised from the dead because Easter is on our calendars. We don\'t even believe in the resurrection because we can visit an empty cave in modern-day Israel. We believe this because God said he raised Jesus of Nazareth from the dead and appointed him Lord and Christ. Let\'s look at Peter\'s declaration on the day of Pentecost:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Acts 2:32 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">32 This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Acts 2:36 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">36 Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.&quot;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">Our starting place for understanding divine healing is not our personal experiences. Our belief that Jesus is a healer is not because he healed someone we know of cancer. Nor should we doubt that Jesus is a healer because someone we know wasn\'t cured of cancer. Our personal experiences do not validate Jesus and his redemptive work or prove God\'s existence. Jesus is a healer because the messianic prophecies about Christ proclaimed that he would vicariously take up our sickness and disease. Further, we believe Jesus finished his work, and therefore, all of God\'s promises belong to the body of Christ. Accordingly, if I never get healed, or if I get healed every time, it doesn\'t change the truth of who Jesus is and what he accomplished.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><a id=\"theimportanceofknowingtruth\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">The Importance of Knowing Truth<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We can readily see that we will be at a tremendous disadvantage if we are ignorant of Jesus\'s saving work. Let\'s look at one aspect of the believer\'s inheritance because of Jesus\'s finished work:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 9:12 New Living Translation (NLT)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">12 With his own blood—not the blood of goats and calves—he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time and secured our redemption forever.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Acts 13:38–39 English Standard Version (ESV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">38 Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, 39 and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">We can see that Jesus\'s death, burial and resurrection accomplished every believer\'s complete and free forgiveness of all sins. This work includes sins God refused to forgive under Moses\'s Law, including blasphemy, murder, fornication, bearing false witness and idolatry. God forgives these terrible sins because of the perfect holiness of Jesus\'s blood. If you do not know these Scriptures and what they mean, you will be disadvantaged because Satan will convince you that you have committed sins that God will not forgive. For this reason, many Christians are crippled by doubt and unbelief as they beg God to forgive them of past sins and failures. They do not understand that God has already forgiven them through Christ! In the mind of God, these sins do not exist anymore. They have been obliterated by the perfect, one-time sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0.3125rem 0 0.6875rem 0.1875rem;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">Another issue in the body is that Christians refuse to forgive their brothers and sisters for past sins that God has forgiven. These Christians hold a grudge toward their sisters and brothers in Christ for being divorced, having a child out of wedlock, or committing adultery (usually, it has to do with sexual sins). Even though God has forgiven the person they hold in contempt, they prefer to keep that person\'s sins and mistakes fresh and in the forefront. (Certain sins disqualify a person from serving in the ministry offices, but that is a different discussion.) Yet again, what people think or feel is irrelevant. The only important truth is the truth of God\'s word.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">Suppose we educate ourselves on the glorious finality of the cross of Christ. In that case, we will understand that God, through Jesus, has completely forgiven all our sins, individually and collectively. That frees us to love one another with doubt and hesitation. We don\'t have to wonder if God has forgiven that person for being divorced and remarried. We don\'t have to doubt whether God loves that child born out of wedlock as much as he loves other children. The same almighty and holy blood that cleansed me of all sin has successfully cleansed you from all sin.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p style=\"margin: 0 0 0 0;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.91rem; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><a id=\"securedbycovenant\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Secured by Covenant<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Jesus\'s sacrifice secured forgiveness of sins and divine healing for sickness, pains, weaknesses and the entire scope of brokenness. This scope includes mild sadness to severe mental illness and demonic oppression.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Now I use the word &quot;guarantee&quot; and &quot;inheritance&quot; deliberately because these are Bible concepts. Part of Jesus\'s present-day ministry is to ensure that we receive what he sacrificed and died for us to receive. Note the following scriptures in Hebrews:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 8:6 New Living Translation (NLT)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">6 But now Jesus, our High Priest, has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood, for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant with God, based on better promises.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Hebrews 9:15 New Living Translation (NLT)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">15 That is why he is the one who mediates a new covenant between God and people, so that all who are called can receive the eternal inheritance God has promised them. For Christ died to set them free from the penalty of the sins they had committed under that first covenant.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">We can readily see at least two reasons why our covenant with God is superior to the covenant under Moses. First, under the New Covenant, all our sins are forgiven eternally and entirely by the blood of Jesus. Second, under the New Covenant, we receive God\'s blessings based on the righteousness of Christ, not our ability to keep the Law of Moses. The foundation of Christ\'s righteousness is the meaning of Jesus being the mediator of a superior covenant. We receive our healing inheritance based on the perfection of Jesus, our high priest. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Ignoring these biblical truths, we will live below our rights and privileges in Christ. Jesus gives us his healing virtue to drive out sickness, disease, weakness, and pain. This deliverance includes freedom from mental oppression, fear, self-loathing, guilt and demonic activity. We are not exempt from sickness, but God gives us the power to drive it out from our bodies by faith based on Jesus\'s perfect and finished work.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">If we do not know these truths, we will pray in vain. For example, we will try to persuade God to heal us based on our good works, such as fasting, praying all night, or reminding God how hard we have worked in the church for the past 37 years. Or we will be resigned to our fate because we believe God is punishing us for past sins and mistakes. Worse, we might even think that God is making us sick to bring glory to himself.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Our carnal opinions about healing are not relevant. What is important is what God\'s word says: <\/span><span class=\"f_quote\">By his stripes, we are healed!<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_2_atoc_\"><a id=\"conclusion\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_2_atoc_\">Conclusion<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In this series on divine healing, we start by laying a foundational understanding of how divine healing and the supremacy of Jesus are connected. Jesus of Nazareth is the man God the Father raised from the dead and appointed Messiah, Lord, Christ and God. Jesus finished the work his Father gave him to do and successfully secured eternal redemption for the Church, which is his body. Part of that redemption is providing divine healing to the body of Christ. Jesus gives the Church healing power to drive out sickness, disease, weakness, pain, and mental oppression from our bodies and those for whom we pray.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">As Christians, we are not exempt from sickness and should not be surprised or alarmed when we become sick. Our sickness is not the consequence of God\'s judgment for our sins, except in rare cases, but the result of living in a dark and fallen world.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_bullet\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 1.5000rem; margin-left: 2.0000rem;\"><span class=\"f_bullet\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:1.5000rem;margin-left:-1.5000rem\">&#8226;<\/span><span class=\"f_bullet\">Jesus has not left the Church as orphans in this dark world but has given us invincible tools to overcome sin, darkness and all the enemy\'s strategies. These tools include the Holy Spirit, the Word of God, the blood of Jesus and love for one another<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.09rem;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Importantly, healing, like all of God\'s promises, is received by faith. Our faith must rest not on our personal experiences or what man has said but on what God\'s word has declared.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_close\"><span class=\"f_close\">In the name of God, Amen.<\/span><\/p>\n\r"
