Then God made you alive with Christ, for he forgave all our sins. 14 He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross. 15 In this way, he disarmed the spiritual rulers and authorities. He shamed them publicly by his victory over them on the cross.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Let’s take the first part of verse 13:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Before we were in Christ, we were utterly helpless and unable to save ourselves from sin. If you have ever been around a dead person, you know that that person cannot do anything. You have never seen a dead man ask for a glass of water, get up to check the time, or heard them snore. Before we were in Christ, you and I were spiritually dead, unable to cleanse ourselves from sin or achieve God’s righteousness by ourselves. This thought is echoed in Paul’s letter to the Ephesians:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Ephesians 2:1–3 New King James Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">And you He made alive<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> who were dead in trespasses and sins<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> 2 in which you once walked according to the course of this world<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> according to the prince of the power of the air<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> 3 among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> and were by nature children of wrath<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> just as the others.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Now listen to that Scripture in a modern translation:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Ephesians 2:1–3 Contemporary English Version (CEV)<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">In the past you were dead because you sinned and fought against God<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> 2 You followed the ways of this world and obeyed the devil<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> He rules the world<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> and his spirit has power over everyone who doesn’t obey God<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> 3 Once we were also ruled by the selfish desires of our bodies and minds<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> We had made God angry<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> and we were going to be punished like everyone else.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Paul describes those who are apart from Christ as “dead<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\">” meaning spiritually dead.
