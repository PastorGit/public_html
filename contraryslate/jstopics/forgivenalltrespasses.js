hmBody:"<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Let’s look at the next part of our text passage in Colossians 2:13–14:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">Then God made you alive with Christ, for he forgave all our sins. He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When we were born again, we were made alive in Christ. The terms &quot; born again” and “made alive in Christ &quot; mean the same thing. In being made alive in Christ, God forgave all our sins. To sin is to break God’s law deliberately. God does not punish innocent people. He does not hold people accountable for that which they could not know. For example, when Israel rebelled against God at Kadesh Barnea and refused to enter the Promised Land, God judged those only 2<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">0 <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">years old and older (Numbers 14).<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In the Law of Moses, some sins would not be forgiven and were punishable by death without any appeal. For example, if you committed adultery, the only recourse was a violent and painful death. There was no number of animals a priest could slay to cover the sin of an adulterer. However, in Christ in Christ, there is no such limitation. Through Christ, God forgives us of even the sins that the blood of bulls and goats could not cover under<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">the Law:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Acts 13:38–39 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">38 Let it be known to you therefore<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> brothers<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_scripture\"> 39 and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Is it any wonder that the writer of Hebrews says that we have a better covenant built upon better promises (Hebrews 8:6)? Our justification in Christ is not limited to the forgiveness of some sins and not others but includes the forgiveness of all our sins.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><a id=\"therecordofcharges\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">The Record of Charges Against Us<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In verse 14 Paul writes:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">Consider Colossians 2:14 in other English translations:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Colossians 2:14 International Children’s Bible<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">We owed a debt because we broke God’s laws. That debt listed all the rules we failed to follow. But God forgave us that debt. He took away that debt and nailed it to the cross.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Colossians 2:14 The Living Bible<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">and blotted out the charges proved against you, the list of his commandments which you had not obeyed. He took this list of sins and destroyed it by nailing it to Christ’s cross.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Colossians 2:14 New Revised Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">14 erasing the record that stood against us with its legal demands. He set this aside, nailing it to the cross.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When a person breaks the law, justice demands that the transgressor is punished. In a court of law, a person’s crimes are clearly documented. Justice requires that how a person breaks the law is documented in detail. &nbsp;Therefore, every time a person break’s God’s law, God, because he is just, documents their transgressions. This is what Paul means he writes about the “record of charges against us”. The phrase in Greek refers to a handwritten document that could be used in a court<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">of law.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">This idea of all our sins being recorded is not farfetched at all. God is holy, just, omniscient and omnipresent. Therefore, God understands the nature and motivation of every transgression perfectly and infallibly records the sinner’s sins<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> It would be impossible for an omniscient, omnipresent God to miss the slightest transgression.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_heading_3_atoc_\"><a id=\"theconsequenceofsins\" class=\"hmanchor\"><\/a><span class=\"f_heading_3_atoc_\">The Consequence of Our Sins<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The wage of sin is death — death to the one who commits the sin. Deuteronomy 28<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">is a graphic and unsparing look at the consequences of sin. In that passage, Moses solemnly recounts the devastating judgment God would visit upon Israel for disobeying His word. God called these punishments “curses”. These curses were the precise opposite of God’s blessings and like God’s blessings<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> were intended to impact every part of human existence, spirit, soul and body.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">In Deuteronomy 28, God promised health, wealth, and a vibrant spiritual relationship for obeying his voice. He likewise promised famine, plague, abject poverty, insanity and spiritual backsliding for disobeying His word. The severe judgment of the Lord was persistent, unyielding, unrelenting and terrifying.
