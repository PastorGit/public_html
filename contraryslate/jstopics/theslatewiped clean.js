hmBody:"<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">The good news is that God removed the record of our sins that was against us! The thought is that if indeed our sins were written down on a slate, then God wiped that slate clean much as an instructor wipes clean a whiteboard<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Illus_head\" style=\"page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_Illus_head\">Illustration of a Clean Slate<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Illustration\" style=\"page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_Illustration\">Usually, when a computer deletes a file, it is moved to electronic trash that awaits to be erased. The file in the trash bin is pending deletion and has not actually been removed from the computer’s hard drive. This safeguard allows a user to retrieve the file if it were accidentally placed in the trash. However, a user may execute the command to empty the trash bin completely and even “shred” its contents, permanently deleting the file from the hard drive. Once that happens, the file is erased and cannot be retrieved.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When God forgave our sins in Christ, he didn’t put them in a trash bin so others could retrieve them and wave them in front of us. He deleted them entirely and forever. How did he do this? By nailing them to the cross<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> Let’s look at the following Scripture:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">1 Peter 2:24 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When Jesus suffered at the hands of the Roman soldiers who beat and crucified him, God placed our sins in his body. Referring to the word picture of Colossians 2:14, Jesus’s body became the documented evidence of every transgression of the human race. As the Roman soldiers were nailing Jesus to the wooden cross, God was nailing the record of charges against us to the cross of<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\"> <\/span><span class=\"f_body\">Jesus. Justice was being served. The evidence of our sins was laid on Jesus, and Jesus suffering and dying was him enduring the punishment for our sins. Note Galatians 3:13:<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture_head\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture_head\">Galatians 3:13 English Standard Version<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_scripture\" style=\"page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-after: avoid;\"><span class=\"f_scripture\">13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us — for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree” — <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When Christ bore the judgment for our sins, he bore the curse of the Law for us. On the cross, God cursed Jesus<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">,<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> who, carrying our sins in his body, bore the total weight of God’s judgment against all our sins<\/span><span class=\"f_body\" style=\"font-family: \'Times New Roman\',Times,Georgia,serif;\">.<\/span><span class=\"f_body\"> Christ’s sacrifice released us from the debt of our sins, even sins that could not be forgiven under the Old Covenant.<\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_body\"><span class=\"f_body\">When Jesus died on the cross, he satisfied God’s wrath and indignation over our transgressions. When God the Father raised Jesus of Nazareth from the dead, the Father certified that Jesus was sinless and divine. Jesus died in our place but could not stay dead because he himself was God and had never sinned (Acts 2:22–24). <\/span><span class=\"f_emphasis\">Therefore, the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus illuminate two realities. The punishment for the believer’s sin has been fully paid for by Jesus, and secondly that no record exists for those sins that Jesus paid for on the cross. <\/span><\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Notes\"><span class=\"f_Notes\"><a href=\"javascript:ScrollTop();\" class=\"scriptlink\">Go to top<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\r"
